// Pins continuation-specific guards to the call sites that must consult them.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Four upstream absorbs in one day each centralised a decision that
// one of our continuation guards lived inside, and the mechanically-clean resolution
// silently deleted the guard every time:
//
//   1. upstream moved assistant-text extraction to a lazy thunk; taking its
//      `sanitizeAssistantText` would have dropped continuation-signal stripping.
//   2. upstream added `params.isCurrent?.() !== false` to a cleanup retry guard while
//      our side had removed the argument that guard reads, making it vacuous.
//   3. upstream extracted prune/cancel/repair into `task-flow-maintenance-policy.ts`,
//      which has no durable-obligation concept, so a terminal flow still owing
//      `terminalNoticePending` would have been pruned and the notice lost.
//
// Every one of those compiles, and every one passes upstream's own tests, because the
// guard's coverage lives in the code being replaced. Type checking cannot see it and
// unit tests do not miss it. This script does.
//
// Each entry names a guard and the modules that MUST call it. Losing a call site is a
// hard failure with the protection spelled out, so the next absorb has to make a
// deliberate decision instead of an accidental one.
