/**
 * Continuation durable-obligation guard for task-flow maintenance.
 *
 * Upstream `715077a3be..4feebfc3da` extracted the prune/cancel/repair decision into
 * `task-flow-maintenance-policy.ts` and added `task-flow-maintenance.worker.ts`. Both
 * are kept byte-identical to upstream here, and neither carries any notion of a
 * durable obligation — our assembly's `shouldPruneFlow` did, and the extraction would
 * otherwise have dropped it silently.
 *
 * A terminal flow still holding pending-obligation state must never be pruned: the
 * obligation is exactly the thing the retention window exists to protect, and pruning
 * loses it with no trace and no failing test.
