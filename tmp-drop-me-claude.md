resolved local = tracking = server at `a214b8d040aee5eb639d1753580d8abeba716593`.

Dispatch-time Gate 2.7 examined all 959 reviewer-visible paths against the
fixed upstream floor: 0 FROZEN-STALE, 190 MIXED-CLOBBER, 454 GENUINE, and
315 SAFE-NEW. The MIXED rows carry 5,477 ranked dropped-line observations and
are a post-merge disposition queue, not an automatic defect verdict.

Gate 2.5 enumerated 1,483 upstream-touched test/support paths between
`93f7152b098beeb9ac64cb9b2437fc45a7558adf` and the pinned floor; 68 intersect
the accepted candidate surface. The canonical primitive-core inventory has 40
entries: 37 resolved paths and 3 absent tombstones, with no unresolved
non-tombstone pattern. The current runbook explicitly retires the unmerged
`feature-audit.sh`; whole-file feature preservation is owned by this canonical
primitive-core inventory, so no substitute script was invented.

Read-only `git merge-tree` predicted 44 textual conflicts across 194
upstream/feature-overlap paths. Independent three-way analysis exposed a schema
v19 composition question: candidate v19 adds recipient-authority convergence,
while upstream v19 adds creator-namespace migration. Direct owner inspection
showed both parents already declare v19 and the v18-to-v19 transaction can run
both disjoint migrations before the single version stamp. The merge will keep
v19 and compose both existing parent contracts; it will not invent an
unapproved v20 surface. Required proof is a deterministic v18 fixture carrying
both legacy shapes, restart/idempotency coverage, and exact parent comparison.

## 2026-08-29 - Sections 1 and 2: exact back-merge and cure decisions

The exact back-merge commit is
`3b854dd1862cae7208f3e031a0a08d276cd8626e`, tree
`8e8109258231a293847733faf0f3f75d54c58449`, with ordered parents
`9de8dd7fcfb34fa1769ff0bfac3790818dc44a15` and
`43a7cb3c92c7b5b8d5ddd56d9d157c009e0c85e5`. It is a normal merge commit;
the accepted candidate remains on its first-parent lineage and the exact pinned
upstream floor is its second parent.

Gate 2 first rejected `3b854dd1862cae7208f3e031a0a08d276cd8626e`
because the two hand-merged compaction test cores were neither accepted blobs
nor exact upstream projections. Successor
`c842f07c267d98ca2c3edb6c29eedfaf2be32a52` restores those two exact accepted
blobs. The rerun reports 40 invariants, 0 failures, 5 exact upstream
projections, and 3 tombstones.

Gate 2.7 on the successor uses the exact pinned second parent as its base and
examines 956 reviewer-visible paths: 0 FROZEN-STALE, 0 MIXED-CLOBBER,
642 GENUINE, and 314 SAFE-NEW. This discharges every material pre-merge MIXED
row because the final branch is now a direct overlay on the pinned upstream
tree; no dropped post-floor content remains in the classifier.

The schema conflict also received a deterministic owner-boundary negative
control. At rejected merge `3b854dd1862`, the existing
`openclaw-agent-participants-migration.test.ts` fails the covenant physical-v18
lineage with noncanonical participant columns/indexes. Restoring unconditional,
structure-gated participant convergence makes all 18 cases pass in the current
worktree, including covenant-v18, upstream-v18, maintenance refusal, rollback,
restart, foreign-key check, and integrity check. Both SHAs share the exact
`pnpm-lock.yaml` blob `1edc779c3467d2f30837b1ae09208fc223fca85c`.

Generated surfaces were regenerated from the merged owners. Prompt snapshot
check reports all 7 files current. Plugin SDK surface reports 148 public
entrypoints, 4,374 exports, 2,598 callable exports, 1,141 deprecated exports,
50 wildcard reexports, and zero forbidden package subpaths.

## 2026-08-29 - Section 3: blocked Gate 2 composition

The current pinned primitive-core contract is internally unsatisfiable for the
compaction hook test/harness pair:

1. The exact accepted `compact.hooks.test.ts` blob calls
   `resetCompactHooksHarnessMocks()` with no workspace argument.
2. The exact upstream projection of `compact.hooks.harness.ts` changes that
   helper to require `workspaceDir` and immediately evaluates
   `join(workspaceDir, "agents/main/agent")`.
3. Keeping the semantic merged test makes Knip and runtime composition valid,
   but Gate 2 rejects the test blob because the upstream patch conflicts and
   cannot project exactly.
4. Restoring the exact accepted test makes Gate 2 green, but Knip reports the
   upstream harness's two exported history mocks unused, and the focused
   compaction hook suite fails all 154 cases before test execution with
   `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` at the missing workspace argument.

This is not repairable inside the current workorder without changing the
canonical primitive inventory, granting an explicit Gate 2 exception, or
weakening the gate through a test-only transform/compatibility shim. The latter
options violate the runbook and repository doctrine. The lane therefore stops
`BLOCKED`, not `READY_FOR_SCRIBE_REVIEW`.

Static gates reached the dead-export scan. Every preceding changed-path gate
was green: conflict markers, max-lines ratchet, assertion safety, changelog
attribution, doctor registry, extension/plugin boundaries, duplicate coverage,
coercion helpers, dependency pins, format after the one repaired import-order
file, npm lock, prompt snapshots, doctor contracts, channel metadata, SQLite
baseline, Plugin SDK exports/surface/deprecation/boundaries, wrapper shadowing,
and package patches. The remaining Knip failure is the exact contradiction
above, not an inherited parent failure: upstream's test consumes both exports,
while the accepted candidate has neither harness export.

The local `git fsck --no-dangling` probe also encountered pre-existing invalid
reflog entries on unrelated shared branch
`codeagent/124337-bounded-43a7-absorb-20260829`; no refs or reflogs outside this
lane were modified.
