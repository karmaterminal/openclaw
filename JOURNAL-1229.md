# Issue 1229 — Discord durable-ingress backlog red reproducer

## Scope

- Issue: `karmaterminal/openclaw#1229`
- Branch: `codeagent/emeric-1229-ingress-backlog-red`
- Base: `bf0aadbc40c25a2d5231f7736633f5fa68ebca5b`
- Goal: add deterministic focused tests that reproduce the durable-ingress head-of-line/backlog behavior and fail on the unmodified product.
- Stop boundary: red test receipt only. Do not implement the product fix, open a PR, merge, deploy, mutate a live queue, or run broad CI.

## Grounded incident frame

- A same-channel head row completed after 496 attempts and 30.52 hours.
- Later pending rows drained oldest-first as fresh room turns.
- Bound direct-message examples were admitted 13.06 hours and 3.48 hours late.
- No second Discord ingress, dead-letter resubmit, outbound duplicate, or continuation cause is claimed.

## Required proof

Use controlled stores/fake time rather than sleeps or a live Discord gateway. Prefer the narrowest owning queue/monitor tests that prove:

1. a retry-delayed or recovered head event can block a newer event in the same lane;
2. an hours-old Discord ambient event can still be adopted as current after recovery because no freshness disposition exists; and
3. the focused test is green before the new assertion and red after it, with the exact failure captured.

Record touched files, exact commands, baseline/result, and the first missing ownership boundary here. Commit and push the test-only red reproducer; do not patch behavior.

### Source frame

- `extensions/discord/src/monitor/ingress.ts`: `inspectDiscordMessage()` maps every `MESSAGE_CREATE` in a Discord channel to `laneKey: channel:<channelId>`; the monitor retention config caps completed/failed rows but supplies no pending TTL, pending max, freshness, or coalescing disposition.
- `src/channels/message/ingress-drain.ts`: `drainOnce()` snapshots all pending rows oldest-first, derives blocked lanes from active claims, claimed rows, and retry-delayed pending rows, then calls `claimNext()` with the same-lane blocked set. A retry-delayed pending head marks the whole lane blocked before a newer same-lane event can be claimed.
- `src/channels/message/ingress-queue.ts`: `listPending()` and `claimNext()` order pending rows by `received_at, event_id`; no age/freshness discriminator participates in claim selection.
- `src/channels/message/ingress-retry-policy.ts`: retry delay is derived from `last_attempt_at`, `attempts`, and the retry backoff; retryable events are dead-lettered only after both attempt floor and minimum age.

### Focused test design

- Owner test file: `src/channels/message/ingress-drain.test.ts`.
- Test 1 creates a controlled queue with fake `now()`, makes the same-lane head fail once as retryable, enqueues a newer addressed row during the backoff window, and asserts the safety contract that the newer addressed row can be adopted instead of being starved by the retry-delayed head.
- Test 2 creates a controlled queue with a 13-hour-old Discord-shaped ambient backlog row and a fresh addressed row on the same `channel:discord-room` lane, then asserts the safety contract that recovery must not adopt the stale ambient row as the current turn ahead of the fresh addressed row.
- No production seams, sleeps, live Discord gateway, live runtime state, broad CI, or production code changes were used.

### First missing ownership boundary

Durable ingress has a lane-serialization owner and a retry owner, but no owner records or consumes an event freshness/coalescing disposition before claim selection. The first missing boundary is the ingress owner that should decide whether stale ambient same-lane backlog remains admissible, is superseded/coalesced, or is terminally dispositioned while preserving current addressed work.
