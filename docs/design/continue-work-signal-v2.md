# RFC: Agent Self-Elected Turn Continuation (`CONTINUE_WORK`)

**Status:** Implemented; durable custody revision for the TaskFlow removal decided in design review, 2026-09-29 (see §5.4)
**Authors:** OpenClaw maintainers
**Date:** March–May 2026; custody revision September 2026

> **Custody revision (September 2026).** Upstream removed the Tasks and TaskFlow runtime in openclaw/openclaw#159179 (`6652f7eac8`). The `flow_runs` table survives, but nothing reads it at runtime any more. This revision re-homes the continuation's durable custody onto owners that upstream kept, and it keeps the public continuation contract. §5.4 is the design of record: the field-by-field replay state, the single transactional authority for elections, the pre-spawn to `subagent_runs` handoff, and the migration of stored TaskFlow rows. Sections marked **Custody revision** describe the target design. A design review approved its architecture and decided its open questions on 2026-09-29 (Q1–Q8, listed in §5.4), and those rulings are folded in. Where they differ from the code that shipped on TaskFlow, the section says so. Upstream citations are `path:symbol@4d8c9bdd`.

This RFC documents a continuation system for persistent OpenClaw sessions. It introduces self-elected turn continuation, delegated follow-up work, same-host targeted delegate returns, context-pressure awareness, and agent-initiated compaction. The implementation is bounded, observable, interruptible, and opt-in.

This mechanism is not a polling convenience. It gives a turn-scoped agent limited authority to make provisions for successor turns: another turn in the same session, a delegated shard, a targeted return to another session, a post-compaction recovery action, or a compaction request that changes the shape of the session before the next agent sees it. The acting agent may not occupy that future context. The substrate therefore records intent in a form a successor can inherit, reject, audit, or complete.

Targeted delegate return is the banner routing primitive: one child can grant another session a turn, wake every known session on the host, or drip silent context into a named session without duplicating the delegate run. That makes continuation a signaling substrate as well as a work-scheduling substrate.

## 1. Problem

### 1.1 Inter-turn inertia

Existing mechanisms for keeping an OpenClaw agent active—heartbeat timers, cron-scheduled wake-ups, loop instructions in system prompts authored by the **human-user** or operator—all work by injecting **external** events on a fixed schedule. They solve the liveness problem: the agent wakes up periodically. They do not solve the **volition** problem: the agent cannot say, mid-work, “I need another turn.” It can only wait for the next scheduled tick.

This distinction matters for three reasons.

First, **context cost.** A heartbeat instruction such as “check all open issues and work on them” occupies space in the context window on every turn, including turns where there is nothing to check. Over thousands of turns and repeated compaction cycles, this static instruction accumulates as the dominant repeated signal in the agent’s working memory—biasing attention toward the polling task and away from the work at hand. The repetition does not merely consume tokens; it shapes what the agent attends to.

Second, **token waste.** Timer-driven polling burns tokens on empty cycles. An agent heartbeating every 60 seconds but with genuine work only once per hour executes 59 empty turns for every productive one.

Third, **granularity.** A cron timer fires on a schedule. The agent knows _during its turn_ whether it has more work. The timer does not know until the next tick. The gap between “I know I have more to do” and “the timer will wake me in 58 seconds” is the inter-turn inertia.

### 1.2 The dwindle pattern

This produces the **dwindle pattern**: an agent with active work in flight decays toward inactivity between unrelated external events. Momentum is lost, context continuity weakens, and work that could have proceeded immediately instead waits for an accidental wake-up.

Observed in production across 4 persistent agent sessions, this pattern consumed substantial productive time each day. The failure mode was not absence of capability; it was absence of an explicit inter-turn continuation primitive.

### 1.3 Requirements for a continuation primitive

A usable continuation primitive for OpenClaw had to satisfy several constraints simultaneously:

1. **Volitional control.** The agent must be able to elect to continue and also elect to stop. This is not an infinite loop with a termination check; it is a choice at each turn boundary.
2. **Same-session continuity.** The common case should preserve the session rather than forcing every continuation through a new child session.
3. **Delegated continuation.** The design must support sub-agent work for cases where a future result, not merely another blank turn, is what matters.
4. **Compaction awareness and preemptive context evacuation.** Persistent sessions need a way to prepare for compaction before the platform forces it.
5. **Bounded operation.** The feature must remain interruptible, rate-limited, observable, and explicitly enabled by the human user.
6. **Fallback behavior.** The mechanism must still work when tools are unavailable, including environments that only allow terminal response tokens.

## 2. Solution

| **successor turn**             | A later turn that receives structure arranged by an earlier turn: a wake, a delegate result, post-compaction context, or a compaction outcome.                                                                                                                                                      |

| **substrate**                  | The mechanism that carries a continuation path: process timer/reservation, the continuation custody store, the session-delivery queue, the subagent registry, or the compaction lifecycle.                                                                                                          |

| **continuation custody store** | The continuation-owned records in the shared state database.

| **custody handoff**            | The point at which a delegate stops being owned by the continuation custody store and becomes a `subagent_runs` row in the subagent registry (§5.4.4).                                                                                                                                              |
| **TaskFlow** (retired)         | The managed-work substrate that held continuation state until #159179.

### 2.2 Unified interface: tools first, response-token fallback

The implemented solution exposes three continuation capabilities as tools on main-session turns when `continuation.enabled: true`, with fallback response tokens when tools are unavailable.

| Capability             | Primary interface      | Fallback                            | Purpose                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Self-elected next turn | `continue_work()`      | `CONTINUE_WORK` / `CONTINUE_WORK:N` | Schedule another turn for the current session                                |
| Delegated work         | `continue_delegate()`  | `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ...]]`        | Dispatch work to a sub-agent, preserve chain semantics, and route the return |
| Volitional compaction  | `request_compaction()` | None                                | Request compaction after preparatory work                                    |

All three tools are fire-and-forget. They schedule their action and return immediately. The current turn continues to completion normally; the follow-up action occurs only after the turn ends.

This yields a strict two-interface model:

- **Primary path:** typed tools with validation, multiple calls per turn where appropriate, and explicit schemas.
- **Fallback path:** response tokens that work when tools are disabled by human-user policy, unavailable to a given depth, or fail in the current turn.

### 2.3 `continue_work()` semantics

`continue_work()` is the same-session continuation primitive.

**Purpose:** request another turn for the current session after an optional delay.

`continue_work()` is temporal self-scheduling, not a loop primitive. Each accepted call elects one successor turn and remains subject to chain, cost, delay, and human-user opt-in bounds. The absence of a continuation request is as meaningful as its presence: the agent can elect to stop.

**Behavior:** calling `continue_work()` schedules a future turn and the current turn completes normally. The call does not terminate the active turn, and it does not force an immediate second generation inside the same turn.

If `delaySeconds` is 30 and the current turn is still active, the 30-second timer starts **after turn completion**, not when the tool call is emitted. The same timing model applies to the `CONTINUE_WORK:30` response token.

**Shipped behavior:** same-session continuation is a durable election. The tool form and the response-token fallback both converge on one `continuation_work` record. That record holds the session key, hop, delay, semantic due time, election time, anchor-finalization time, reason, origin run and turn, the parent run when there is true spawn lineage, and chain metadata. In-process timers are hedge timers only. They may mature a due record promptly, but they are not the source of truth. Gateway startup recovery re-arms or matures queued work from the durable record.

**Custody revision:** the `continuation_work` record moves from a TaskFlow `flow_runs` row (`core/continuation-work` controller) to a `work` record in the continuation custody store (§5.4). That store is the only transactional authority for elections: election, replacement of parked work, claim, the delivered mark, requeue, terminalization and the terminal-notice obligation are all compare-and-set writes in that one store. Session pending inputs and cron are **not** election authorities (§5.4.3). Every field listed above keeps its meaning and moves as listed in §5.4.2.

When a `continuation_work` row matures while the session is idle, the dispatcher grants a turn to the **same session** directly through the universal reply executor (`getReplyFromConfig`) with a `[continuation:wake]` system event and provenance banner. When the semantic due time arrives while a later turn for the same session is already active, the row does not stack a naked later wake and does not re-anchor its delay. Instead, the dispatcher delivers one trusted `[system:continuation-note]` into the active turn, quotes the original reason as prior intent, includes age/overdue and origin provenance, instructs the successor to re-evaluate before acting, and terminalizes the row only after durable note delivery succeeds. It does not call `requestHeartbeatNow()` or `runHeartbeatOnce()`, because heartbeat registration, active-hours, deferral, and busy skip gates are heartbeat policy rather than same-session continuation policy. The session-store entry must still exist when the row matures, so sub-agent cleanup and archive sweeps retain child sessions with live or recently granted continuation work.

**Safety model:** the scheduled continuation remains subject to chain-length and token-budget guards. If the current self-continuation chain has already exhausted its configured `maxChainLength` or `costCapTokens` budget within the unbroken self-chain, the call is rejected and the agent may stop, persist state to files, or choose another recovery path. (A fresh non-continuation turn-entry — genuine user message, heartbeat, or external system event — resets the chain budget per the per-turn chain-reset semantic in §3.3; the budgets bound unattended-loop depth, not session lifetime.)

### 2.4 `continue_delegate()` semantics and return modes

`continue_delegate()` is the delegated continuation primitive.

**Purpose:** dispatch a sub-agent with typed task, mode, and delay parameters, then route its completion back into the parent continuation chain.

`continue_delegate()` externalizes a shard of future cognition. The task string is a letter to a successor worker: it must carry scope, evidence requirements, desired return shape, and the parent action it is meant to enable.

**Shipped behavior:** the current tool schema exposes `task`, `delaySeconds`, `mode`, `targetSessionKey`, `targetSessionKeys`, `fanoutMode`, `returnOptions`, `recipientContext`, `model`, `attachments`, and `attachAs`. The default completion recipient remains the session that dispatched the delegate. Explicit target fields route the same completion envelope through the `session-delivery-queue` substrate to other known sessions on the same host. Delegates using `normal` mode and no explicit target keep the existing visible announce behavior; targeted returns are delivered as session-addressed enrichment events so one delegate completion can fan out byte-identically without duplicating the delegate run.

Typed input attachments use this shape:

```ts
attachments: Array<{
  name: string;
  content: string;
  encoding?: "utf8" | "base64";
  mimeType?: string;
}>;
attachAs?: {
  mountPath?: string;
};
```

These fields carry scoped input into the **new child delegate workspace**. The workspace is the child execution workspace selected by the shared spawn contract—the target-agent workspace or an explicit child `cwd`. Per-session isolation comes from the private UUID receipt directory; this feature does not provision a separate workspace for every child. An accepted non-empty attachment array is a bounded snapshot **by value at tool dispatch**, not a source path, URL, workspace scan, or later-resolved reference. An omitted or empty `attachments` array means no snapshot. Non-empty arrays contain 1–50 entries. An omitted or empty `attachAs` object means no mount hint, and a mount hint is ignored unless `attachments` is non-empty. A non-empty `mountPath` is trimmed to its canonical value before durable enqueue and accepts only ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, `/`, and `:`; unsafe or control-bearing hints are rejected. The hint affects only the child prompt—it is not an alternate materialization destination.

The fields use the same validation, limits, private receipt directory, per-file hashes, cleanup policy, and `tools.sessions_spawn.attachments` configuration as `sessions_spawn` attachments. Immediate, delayed/recovered, and post-compaction typed delegates retain the snapshot until child spawn or a crash-safe post-compaction queue handoff. The snapshot bytes do not sit in the durable record. They live in a private payload file under `<stateDir>/attachments/continuation/<attachmentId>/payload.json` (at most 8 MiB), and the file is bound to its record ID and owner session. The durable record carries only `attachmentId` and `attachmentCount`. Terminal records keep lifecycle and routing state, but they drop `attachmentId`, and the payload file is released. **Custody revision:** the owning record moves from a TaskFlow row to a continuation custody store `delegate` record (§5.4). New payload files live under a separate root, `<stateDir>/attachments/continuation-custody/`. Custody passes to the subagent registry's own `attachmentId` receipt directory at the custody handoff (§5.4.4). Newly persisted `continue_delegate` tool calls replace each `attachments[].content` value with the established redaction marker, remove each private attachment filename, and preserve only the task plus replay-safe encoding/MIME metadata; `attachAs` is projected to its single mount-path field and removed when no non-empty snapshot exists. A legacy already-redacted snapshot that retains `name` remains replay-safe as-is, so signed historical turns are not mutated or dropped. This does not change the separate trusted-transcript behavior of `sessions_spawn`. Post-compaction queue recovery runtime-validates the discriminated payload and strict attachment members. Malformed records are dead-lettered with structural-only diagnostics, and their raw queue JSON is replaced so attachment bytes do not remain in the failed row. The tool result reports only attachment count and canonical mount options, never attachment content.

The `attachments` and `attachAs` fields are an input contract, not an attachment-bearing return contract. Managed output artifacts use the shipped claim path instead: `returnOptions` activates a host-owned policy, the child explicitly publishes bounded candidates with `delegate_artifacts_publish`, and recipients receive metadata-only claim projections plus arrival context through durable continuation return delivery. Authorized recipients explicitly list, inspect, materialize, or discard claims. This path does not reuse input attachments, copy payload bytes into the return envelope, auto-mount bytes, prompt-inject bytes, channel-upload them, or generically render or forward them; those automatic byte-presentation surfaces remain future work.

**What the target fields do — and explicitly do not — do.** Every `continue_delegate()` call spawns a fresh sub-agent owned by the dispatcher (a new session under `agent:<targetAgentId>:subagent:<UUID>`). The fresh sub-agent receives the `task` body, runs it, and produces a completion envelope. The `targetSessionKey`, `targetSessionKeys`, and `fanoutMode` fields control **where that completion envelope is delivered** when the fresh sub-agent finishes. They do not redirect the task body, they do not wake an existing session's run loop with the original task, and they do not route work into a named live-attached recipient. A live-attached recipient named via `targetSessionKey` will see only the post-completion `[continuation:enrichment-return]` envelope; it will never see the original `task` string from this primitive.

Probes that test for task-routing semantics (for example, asking the named target to reply with a unique nonce on its bound channel) will observe zero nonce hits and a reply emitted from a fresh subagent UUID. That observation is consistent with the shipped contract; it is not evidence of a routing bug. Cross-session task delivery — addressing an existing session's run loop with a new prompt — is a separate primitive that is out of scope for this RFC.

On the recipient's next turn, the reply runner drains that session-scoped system-event queue and prepends the completion envelope as `System:` context. In `silent-wake` mode the return also requests a `delegate-return` heartbeat for every targeted recipient, so a dormant channel-bound session can wake, consume its own enrichment copy, and produce normal turn output informed by that context. The target is not expected to echo the completion nonce verbatim unless its next turn independently chooses to do so.

The shipped return-target modes are:

1. **Default:** omit targeting fields and return to the dispatching session.
2. **Single other session:** set `targetSessionKey` to return to one explicitly addressed session, such as a root or depth-1 ancestor.
3. **Multiple sessions:** set `targetSessionKeys` to return one byte-identical completion envelope to every listed session.
4. **Tree fan-out:** set `fanoutMode: "tree"` to return to every ancestor in the current sub-agent/continuation chain.
5. **Host fan-out:** set `fanoutMode: "all"` to return to every known session on the same host.

Multi-recipient return is distinct from multi-delegate fan-out: multi-delegate fan-out runs N delegates that may produce N different artifacts; multi-recipient return runs one delegate and delivers the same completion envelope to N recipients. Aspect multiplexing, per-receiver transformation, backpressure-aware multicast, cross-host publish/subscribe, and SeedLink-style broadcast remain the higher broadcast layer; they do not replace this shipped session-addressed return primitive.

Compared with the delegate response token, `continue_delegate()` adds three core properties:

1. **Multi-delegate fan-out.** Multiple calls in one turn can dispatch multiple delegates in parallel.
2. **Typed parameters.** Delay, mode, task, return targets, and input attachments are schema-validated rather than parsed from free text.
3. **Tool-surface discoverability.** The tool is presented directly in the agent’s available interface when enabled.

The delegate return modes are:

| Mode               | Channel echo | Wake parent           | Use case                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `normal` (default) | ✅           | ✅                    | Standard delegate completion                                                      |
| `silent`           | ❌           | ❌                    | Passive enrichment that should color a later turn without waking immediately      |
| `silent-wake`      | ❌           | ✅                    | Quiet background cognition that should trigger the next turn automatically        |
| `post-compaction`  | ❌           | ✅ (after compaction) | Evacuation or resume work that should be released only after compaction completes |

**`silent:`** the sub-agent result is delivered through `enqueueSystemEvent()` instead of the normal announce path. Internally, the `silentAnnounce` flag threads through spawn and registry paths to gate the delivery decision point. The parent absorbs the result on a later turn but is not woken.

**`silent-wake:`** channel output remains suppressed, but the return triggers a generation cycle through `requestHeartbeatNow()`. This enables quiet background processing without visible channel noise.

**`post-compaction:`** the delegate is staged on the session until compaction completes, then released into the successor session alongside workspace boot files and post-compaction lifecycle context.

**`model:`** an optional provider/model override for the spawned delegate, for example `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.6`. Omitted — or the sentinel value `"default"` — leaves the delegate inheriting the dispatching session's model, which is the existing, fully backward-compatible behavior. Supplied, it routes the fresh sub-agent to that provider/model so a parent can cost-route a fan-out (for example an Opus parent dispatching Sonnet or Haiku children). This is the delegate-side twin of `sessions_spawn(model)` and shares its contract: the model string is not validated at dispatch time; unknown refs resolve, or fail, downstream when the sub-agent is spawned. `model` composes with every return mode, with `delaySeconds`, with `post-compaction` staging, and with the response-token fallback.

The delegate response token uses the same targeting contract for fallback/directive paths:

```text
[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: task | target=session-key]]
[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: task | targets=key1,key2,key3]]
[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: task | fanout=tree]]
[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: task | fanout=all]]
[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: task | model=provider/model]]
[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: task | model=sonnet | fanout=tree]]
```

The response-token form does **not** accept inline attachment blobs. Text such as `attachment=...` remains part of the delegate task; it is not parsed into an attachment field. A token-path task may refer to a file that already exists in the shared workspace, but models and callers must not treat `attachment=` as supported token syntax. `continue_work()` also has no attachment fields.

Without `silent-wake`, parent-orchestrated chain hops can stall until an unrelated external message arrives.

### 2.5 `request_compaction()` semantics

`request_compaction()` is the agent-initiated compaction primitive.

**Purpose:** allow the agent to prepare working state, then request compaction on its own schedule rather than waiting for overflow.

`request_compaction()` is the agent asking to become smaller under controlled conditions. It does not compact immediately and it does not let a child compact its parent. It asks the platform to perform the lifecycle transition after the current turn, after the agent has had a chance to evacuate state.

**Behavior:** the tool enqueues compaction and returns immediately. The current turn finishes normally; compaction runs between turns on the same path used by platform compaction.

`request_compaction()` operates on **the current session only**. If a delegate calls `request_compaction()`, it compacts the delegate’s session, not the parent. This isolation is intentional: a child should not compact the parent session through an inadvertent tool call.

The tool has no response-token fallback. Volitional compaction is tool-only in the current design.

`request_compaction()` works in concert with context-pressure awareness (§4.2) and post-compaction delegate release (§4.4): the agent notices rising pressure, prepares working state, stages recovery delegates, and then elects compaction. The three capabilities together form a volitional compaction lifecycle—awareness, preparation, and execution—all under agent control.

The intended lifecycle has three pressure points:

1. **Initial context-window evaluation.** When a session is new to a context window, the platform can establish the habit of regular evacuation: save useful working shape early, not only at crisis time.
2. **Rising pressure.** As context usage grows, advisory events should make evacuation more salient and let the agent choose between staging recovery work, writing durable notes, or requesting compaction at a time it controls.
3. **High pressure.** At roughly 90% and above, the advisory should make elective `request_compaction()` the obvious safe option. Choosing compaction before the hard overflow boundary is usually better than being compacted at window exhaustion, possibly mid-turn.

This cycle is the **lich pattern**: the agent electively arranges the payload that should enrich its successor after compaction. It is a savegame for after compaction, chosen by the agent rather than imposed by the platform. Over dozens or hundreds of compactions, the session can keep re-creating the working shape it chose to preserve: files, staged delegates, silent returns, and post-compaction recovery tasks.

### 2.6 Response-token fallback and token interaction

When tools are unavailable, the continuation system falls back to terminal response tokens:

```text
CONTINUE_WORK                 → schedule another turn with default delay
CONTINUE_WORK:30              → schedule another turn 30 seconds after turn completion
[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: <task>]] → dispatch a delegate sub-agent
DONE                          → default inert state until another external event
```

The term **response token** covers both bare terminal tokens such as `CONTINUE_WORK` and delimited body-carrying tokens such as `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ...]]`. The square brackets are only the delimiter for the delegate token body; they are not a separate interface.

Limitations of response-token fallback:

- One continuation signal per response.
- End-anchored parsing.
- No multi-delegate fan-out in a single turn.
- No fallback form for `request_compaction()`.

Parser constraints are part of the portable interface:

- The runner scans backward to the last text payload before parsing, because tool-call payloads may follow the response text.
- Response tokens take precedence over a same-turn `continue_work()` tool request when both exist.
- The delegate parser matches the last end-anchored `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ...]]` block and supports multiline task bodies.
- Delegate fallback accepts an optional `+Ns` suffix for spawn delay; optional `| silent` / `| silent-wake` suffixes; optional `| target=...`, `| targets=...`, or `| fanout=tree|all` return-target directives; and an optional `| model=<provider/model>` override that routes the spawned delegate to a specific model (omitted => inherit the parent session's model). Example: `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: task | model=sonnet | fanout=tree]]`. The model string is not validated at parse time; an empty `model=` value is rejected as malformed.
- Delegate fallback has no attachment directive. `attachment=...` is ordinary task text; reference an existing workspace file or use the typed tool instead.
- Delegate fallback task text is truncated to 4096 characters, matching the tool schema.
- `CONTINUE_WORK` accepts an optional integer seconds suffix as `CONTINUE_WORK:N`.

`NO_REPLY` is a silence token, not a continuation token. Ordering matters: if the turn should be silent and also schedule continuation, the continuation token must remain terminal in the raw response so the continuation parser sees it first; after stripping that continuation token, `NO_REPLY` must be the only remaining displayed text.

Token interaction remains straightforward:

| Raw response shape                           | Behavior                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NO_REPLY` then terminal `CONTINUE_WORK`     | Strip continuation, leave `NO_REPLY`, suppress channel output, schedule continuation |
| `HEARTBEAT_OK` then terminal `CONTINUE_WORK` | Acknowledge heartbeat, then schedule continuation                                    |
| Response text then terminal `CONTINUE_WORK`  | Deliver response text, then schedule continuation                                    |
| `CONTINUE_WORK` alone                        | Schedule continuation with no substantive response text                              |

### 2.7 Capability-tier hierarchy

The system follows a three-tier capability hierarchy.

```text
Tier 1: continuation.enabled=true and tools available
  → use continue_work(), continue_delegate(), request_compaction()
  → response tokens remain available as same-turn fallback if tool use fails

Tier 2: continuation.enabled=true and tools denied by policy or depth
  → use CONTINUE_WORK or CONTINUE_WORK:N
  → use [[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ...]]
  → request_compaction() unavailable

Tier 3: continuation.enabled=false
  → no continuation features available
  → standard single-turn behavior
```

```mermaid

    A["Agent wants a successor-turn action"] --> B{"continuation.enabled?"}
    B -- "false" --> OFF["Tier 3: no continuation surface; ordinary single-turn behavior"]
    B -- "true" --> C{"typed tool registered and available in this turn?"}
    C -- "yes" --> D["Tier 1: prefer tool call"]
    D --> E{"tool call accepted?"}
    E -- "yes: continue_work" --> W["schedule same-session wake after turn"]
    E -- "yes: continue_delegate" --> G["enqueue/drain delegate work"]
    E -- "yes: request_compaction" --> Q["enqueue async compaction"]
    E -- "no / tool denied / leaf policy" --> F{"terminal response token present?"}
    C -- "no" --> F
    F -- "CONTINUE_WORK[:N]" --> W
    F -- "[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ...]]" --> G
    F -- "none" --> IDLE["turn ends; no elected continuation"]
    F -- "request_compaction wanted" --> NOFALL["unavailable: no response-token fallback"]
```

The hierarchy is a decision rule, not a user-facing mode switch. Tier 2 is selected by capability or policy failure; agents should prefer typed tools when the gateway presents them.

### 2.8 Design rationale

1. **Gate by capability, not turn type.** Tool visibility is controlled by `continuation.enabled`, while abuse prevention is handled by runtime guards such as `maxDelegatesPerTurn`, `maxChainLength`, and `costCapTokens`.
2. **Prefer structured invocation.** Tools avoid the fragility of regex parsing and allow explicit schemas.
3. **Support width.** Fleet-scale fan-out requires multiple delegates in one turn; the response-token path cannot express that efficiently.
4. **Keep the interface self-describing.** When tools are available, the continuation surface appears explicitly in the tool inventory rather than relying on prior knowledge of terminal tokens.
5. **Reuse implementation paths.** Tools and response tokens converge on the same signal extraction, durable custody scheduling, budget, and dispatch machinery.

In OpenClaw, `continue_work()` is the first primitive that lets an agent say “I am not done yet” without trapping it in a loop that cannot also say “I am done.”

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Architecture

The implementation hooks into existing gateway layers rather than adding a parallel runner.

1. **Token parsing:** `parseContinuationSignal()` and `stripContinuationSignal()` in `src/auto-reply/continuation/signal.ts` detect and remove continuation tokens from displayed output.
2. **Signal detection:** the main reply runner, follow-up runner, and spawn-init attempt path inspect finalized payloads and typed tool callbacks with `extractContinuationSignal()`, so typed `continue_work()` and `CONTINUE_WORK[:N]` fallback produce the same work signal.
3. **Same-session work scheduling:** `scheduleContinuationWork()` persists a `continuation_work` election and advances continuation chain state after the current turn completes. The durable record, not the timer handle, is the election. **Custody revision:** the record is a `work` record in the continuation custody store. Election and parked-work replacement commit in one owner-conditioned state-database transaction (§5.4.3).
4. **Same-session work dispatch:** `dispatchPendingContinuationWork()` consumes matured rows, enqueues `[continuation:wake]`, checks that the elected session is present and not already active, then calls `getReplyFromConfig()` directly for that same `SessionKey`. Busy sessions are requeued instead of orphaned.
5. **Delegate queueing:** tool-path delegates, including typed input attachments and mount options, are enqueued via `enqueuePendingDelegate()` and consumed after the response finishes, or after a follow-up or announce boundary drains the same queue. **Custody revision:** the pre-spawn owner is a `delegate` record in the continuation custody store. The record hands custody to a `subagent_runs` row at child admission, under a precomputed child run ID (§5.4.4).
6. **Return routing:** delegate completions resolve default, explicit, multi-recipient, tree, or host-wide return targets and deliver same-host targeted returns through `session-delivery-queue`.
7. **Lifecycle dispatch:** post-compaction delegates are staged as durable records and released through the compaction completion path into `session-delivery-queue` delivery. **Custody revision:** staging is a `post_compaction` record in the continuation custody store. Release enqueues the queue entry and marks the record handed off in one state-database transaction (§5.4.4). This replaces TaskFlow's "succeeded at claim revision + 1" handoff convention.

No new transport layer is introduced. Continuation uses system events, existing sub-agent dispatch, same-host session delivery, and the standard reply executor. Same-session `continue_work` deliberately avoids the heartbeat wake substrate; silent delegate returns still use their existing wake path.

### 3.2 Delegate dispatch walkthrough

The delegate path has two ingress forms that converge at spawn but differ in durability before spawn.

#### Turn 0: emit and strip

Suppose the agent emits:

```text
Here is the PR review summary.

[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: verify the test suite passes and report results +10s]]
```

For response-token fallback, the gateway then:

1. Parses the terminal delegate response token.
2. Strips it from displayed output, so the user sees only the review summary.
3. Enqueues a durable delegate record with task, origin run, clamped delay, mode, model, and return-target metadata if present, through the same `enqueuePendingDelegate()` path as the typed tool, and persists chain state. A `| post-compaction` token stages a post-compaction record instead.
4. Arms a hedge timer for the due time. The timer only prompts a drain; the record is the durable state.

**Correction:** earlier revisions described the token form as a process-scoped reservation. At C (`7b3815d7`) `agent-runner-continuation-signal.ts` already calls `enqueuePendingDelegate()` and `stagePostCompactionDelegate()` for the token form. It therefore crosses the same durable store as the tool, carrying no attachment reference. The rest of this RFC uses that behavior.

For the typed tool path, the gateway instead writes a durable custody record:

1. `continue_delegate()` validates `task`, `delaySeconds`, `mode`, optional return targeting, and typed input attachments.
2. `enqueuePendingDelegate()` commits a queued durable record that preserves the attachment reference and mount options for the later child spawn. At C the row committed first and the payload file was written afterwards; a payload write failure failed the row. **Custody revision:** the payload file is written first, bound to a pre-minted record ID, and the record commits second. The tool reports `scheduled` only after that commit. A crash between the two writes leaves only an unreferenced file, which the startup custody reconcile deletes (§5.4.4, boundary 0).
3. `consumePendingDelegates()` drains only matured records. Unmatured records stay queued until `createdAt + delayMs`.
4. `peekSoonestUnmaturedDelegateDueAt()` lets the dispatcher arm a hedge timer so a quiet channel still re-drains at the next due time.
5. Corrupt records are logged with structural diagnostics only and terminalized as `failed`. Their attachment reference is scrubbed and the payload file released. They are not silently dropped.

**Custody revision:** at C (`7b3815d7`) these steps wrote TaskFlow rows under the `core/continuation-delegate` and `core/continuation-post-compaction` controllers, and corrupt rows went through `failFlow`. After the revision they write continuation custody store records through state-database worker operations (§5.4). Claiming a matured record for spawn is a separate compare-and-set write. It records the spawn attempt and the precomputed child run ID before `spawnSubagentDirect()` runs, which gives restart recovery an exact key to look up in `subagent_runs` (§5.4.4). A post-compaction record differs: its first `running` state is a **release claim**, not a spawn claim, and carries no attempt. Its child run ID becomes durable atomically with the session-delivery queue insert and the permanent handoff, and `deliveryStartedAt` is persisted before the drain spawns (§5.4.4, "Post-compaction"). "`running` implies a recorded attempt" therefore holds for pending delegates only (design review, 2026-09-29).

The durability contract is path-specific:

| Path                             | Pre-dispatch state                                                                              | Restart behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

A claimed record is reconciled against `subagent_runs` by its precomputed child run ID (§5.4.4). If a restart leaves the claim unresolved, the record ends with one `[continuation:delegate-spawn-interrupted]` notice and is never re-spawned. Hedge timer state is process-scoped. |
| `mode="post-compaction"`         | Custody store `post_compaction` record, then session-delivery queue entry after release         | Staged work survives until consumed, expired, cancelled, or released; the release commits the queue entry and the handed-off mark together; queued delivery has retry/restart semantics.                                                                                                                                               |

#### Gap window

Between scheduling and spawn, the parent session is idle while a durable custody record is live. This is the principal temporal gap for audit and security analysis. Typed attachment content stays in the private payload file referenced by the custody record until materialization. The token path stores only task text and routing metadata, and both forms cross the same durable store (the token form is recorded as a delegate record with no attachment reference). Neither path carries a private cryptographic capability.

#### Spawn and wake

When the timer fires, `spawnSubagentDirect()` creates the child session, materializes any typed attachments under the child's private `.openclaw/attachments/<id>` receipt directory, carries forward delivery context, records `[continuation:delegate-spawned]`, and advances accepted chain state. Attachment names, encodings, sizes, and mount hints pass through the same validation and limits as `sessions_spawn`.

When the child completes, the existing announce path delivers untargeted results back to the dispatching session. Targeted returns resolve one or more same-host recipient session keys and deliver a byte-identical completion envelope through `session-delivery-queue`; `silent-wake` targets also request a heartbeat wake for those recipients. The wake is classified through structured continuation metadata such as `continuationTrigger: "delegate-return"`, allowing a successor turn to distinguish internal continuation from unrelated user input.

A representative timeline is:

```text
t=0s    emit [[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: task +10s]]
        → parse and strip
        → commit a durable delegate record with default return target
        → arm hedge timer

t=10s   timer fires
        → spawnSubagentDirect()
        → persist accepted hop label
        → enqueue [continuation:delegate-spawned]
        → child begins work

t≈20s   child completes
        → result delivered to parent
        → wake classified as delegate-return
        → parent resumes with child result in context
```

A targeted return changes only the completion routing:

```text
t=0s    continue_delegate(task="inspect leaf state", fanoutMode="tree", mode="silent-wake")
        → commit a custody-store delegate record with tree fan-out return target

t=10s   depth-3 child completes
        → resolver expands tree to root + ancestors
        → one completion envelope is enqueued to each ancestor session
        → recipients receive silent enrichment; wakeable recipients get delegate-return heartbeats
```

### 3.3 Announce payloads and chain tracking

When the child finishes, `runSubagentAnnounceFlow()` assembles an internal completion payload that includes task label, status, result text, reply guidance, and return-routing metadata. The default recipient receives this as an inbound event and resumes work. Targeted recipients receive the same completion text as session-addressed system events.

The task string effectively becomes a letter to the future turn. Any useful context embedded in that task survives into the child prompt and the later completion payload.

Input attachments stop at the child workspace boundary. They are not copied back into the completion payload. The missing return-attachment seam (§A.6) starts where `readSubagentOutput()` selects text from child history, continues through the text-only event assembled by `runSubagentAnnounceFlow()`, and ends at `enqueueContinuationReturnDeliveries({ text })`. A future return-attachment contract must define structured capture, persistence, recipient rendering or mounting, cleanup, and fan-out semantics across that whole path.

Session metadata tracks continuation state through:

- `continuationChainCount`
- `continuationChainStartedAt`
- `continuationChainTokens`
- `continuationChainId`

**Chain-state lifecycle.** These four fields accumulate together within an unbroken self-continuation chain and **reset together** at turn-entry whenever the inbound origin is not a mid-chain continuation-wake (the `!isContinuationWake` gate evaluated at `get-reply-run.ts`). The reset fires before `loadContinuationChainState` reads the SessionEntry, so a fresh turn opens with `chain 0/maxChainLength` and a freshly minted `continuationChainId`; a fresh turn that itself elects a continuation then advances the new chain from 0 (not from the prior carried count). Only genuine mid-chain wakes preserve the accumulating count so a runaway self-loop still trips the cap: `work-wake` (a `continue_work` timer firing) and an in-chain `delegate-return` (a `[continuation:chain-hop:N]` return — part of a chain the session itself elected). An **ordinary** inter-session subagent completion is classified separately as `subagent-return`: it is an external turn-entry, not a self-elected continuation hop, so it does **not** set `isContinuationWake` and therefore resets the chain budget like any other fresh turn. Without that distinction a long-lived session with a stale at-cap chain count would reject every continuation elected from an unrelated subagent return (the doom-lock).

The full session-rotation reset path (`agent-runner-session-reset.ts`, fired by `/reset`, compaction-failure-recovery, role-ordering-conflict, or ACP-explicit-`resetSession`-flag) clears these fields as part of a broader sessionId-mint and continues to apply for those error-recovery paths; the per-turn chain-reset above is the additive shipped behavior that bounds the leash to _unattended_ self-continuation rather than session lifetime.

Delayed delegates reserve future hop labels before spawn and persist accepted hop state only after acceptance. This keeps planned work distinct from accepted chain state and prevents retries or pre-spawn failures from consuming chain budget.

For response-token chain hops, the hop label is encoded directly in the task prefix as `[continuation:chain-hop:N]`. This is necessary because inbound messages reset some session-level counters between hops.

Budget inheritance follows three rules:

1. **Chain index:** child hop labels advance within the configured maximum.
2. **Token budget:** `continue_work()` chains and tool-path delegate chains accumulate against `costCapTokens`; response-token chain cost accumulation exists but remains less reliable at the announce boundary because child token data may not yet be written.
3. **Delay bounds:** each hop is clamped to runtime-configured `minDelayMs` and `maxDelayMs`.

Follow-up turns also drain the `continue_delegate` queue and persist advanced chain state. Without that follow-up drain, delegates scheduled by a continuation turn would wait for the next unrelated inbound message rather than continuing the chain they were created to serve.

**Trace context.** The desired trace shape is that a root turn, depth-1 child, deeper child, and cross-session return all remain in one trace: the root has a trace id and span, each delegate receives that trace id with its parent span, and returning results keep the trace id plus the producing span so enqueue, delivery, and successor-turn spans can be assembled later. The substrate already has the pieces for that shape: system events and queued session delivery payloads can carry W3C `traceparent`, and the diagnostics-otel adapter stitches spans to a supplied `traceparent` (§6.6). The end-to-end propagation contract — producer-IN, return-OUT (default/targeted/multi/fanout), restart-resilience, and chain-budget anti-flood accounting — is documented in §6.8, with seam-by-seam implementation references and a verification contract.

### 3.4 Tool implementation and prompt gating

`continue_work()` and `continue_delegate()` are structured entry points into shared continuation machinery.

For `continue_delegate()` specifically:

- tool calls enqueue durable custody records (TaskFlow rows at C; continuation custody store records after the custody revision, §5.4); runtime objects use `mode` as the single source of truth, while boolean flags remain only a persisted compatibility projection;
- typed input attachments and `attachAs` mount options use the shared sub-agent attachment contract and remain referenced by the durable record until child spawn;
- `agent-runner.ts`, `followup-runner.ts`, and the announce path consume that queue after the relevant generation boundary;
- delayed tool delegates use filter-at-consume plus the hedge timer described above;
- response-token fallback enqueues the same durable records without attachments.

The tool is denied to **leaf** sub-agents through `SUBAGENT_TOOL_DENY_LEAF`, but remains available to orchestrator sub-agents and continuation chain hops below maximum depth.

Consumption differs by context:

- **Main sessions:** post-response consumption in `agent-runner.ts`.
- **Spawned sub-agents:** announce-boundary consumption in `subagent-announce.ts`, using the requester session as the topology root.

The routing distinction matters. Spawned sub-agents run with `deliver: false` and reach generation through the ingress path (`agentCommandFromIngress` → `runEmbeddedPiAgent`) rather than the ordinary reply path (`get-reply-run.ts` → `runReplyAgent`). The announce-boundary consumer exists specifically so these child sessions can still create the next delegate hop while preserving parent-rooted topology through `targetRequesterSessionKey`.

The system prompt branches on tool availability in `src/agents/system-prompt.ts`:

- when tools are present, the prompt teaches the tool path first and labels response tokens as fallback;
- when tools are absent, the prompt teaches response tokens only.

This keeps the agent’s taught interface aligned with the actual capability surface.

### 3.5 Temporal sharding with context attachments

Continuation is not limited to “same session, one more turn.” Both `sessions_spawn` and the typed `continue_delegate()` tool can create a child with scoped inline input attachments, and continuation can combine that child input with delayed dispatch and targeted text return.

This yields **temporal sharding**:

```text
agent receives complex task
  → spawns N sub-agents with sessions_spawn or continue_delegate and scoped inline attachments
  → sub-agents execute in parallel over different horizons
  → completions return to the parent, a named sibling, the ancestor tree, or all known sessions
  → parent synthesizes
  → parent elects continue_work() or DONE
```

Inline context attachments can include:

- memory files,
- partial results from prior shards,
- narrowed project specifications,
- diffs or code fragments,
- human-user-provided working notes.

This turns either typed child-spawn surface from “start a task” into “start a task with scoped memory already attached.” `sessions_spawn` is the explicit child-task primitive. `continue_delegate()` adds continuation chain accounting, delayed and post-compaction durability, and return modes while reusing the same attachment materializer. `continue_work()` and `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ...]]` remain attachment-free.

These are parent-to-child input attachments only. The text completion paths described below do not provide the structured child-to-parent return attachments defined in §A.6.

Targeted return adds an out-of-tree path back to a useful recipient. A depth-3 leaf can return directly to root; a verifier can wake the sibling session that owns deployment; a monitor can drip silent context into a session that should learn the fact but should not speak yet. `fanoutMode: "tree"` addresses every ancestor in the current chain, while `fanoutMode: "all"` addresses every known session on the host. This is why targeted return is a signaling primitive, not merely a delegate convenience.

```text
root
  → planner
    → shard A
      → leaf detects urgent state
      → leaf returns with fanoutMode="tree" and mode="silent-wake"

delivery:
  root receives wake + enrichment
  planner receives wake + enrichment
  shard A receives wake + enrichment
  unrelated host sessions are untouched unless fanoutMode="all" was requested
```

### 3.6 Persistence and restart-survival

Continuation is not carried by one substrate. Each path has its own persistence and failure semantics:

| Path                                             | Substrate (custody revision)                                                                                     | Durability                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Important failure behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

At C (`7b3815d7`) the first four rows were TaskFlow `flow_runs` rows under the `core/continuation-work`, `core/continuation-delegate` and `core/continuation-post-compaction` controllers. After the custody revision (§5.4), the continuation custody store holds them.

**Session-delivery queue scope.** `session-delivery-queue` is a local-gateway substrate keyed by `sessionKey`. It accepts `systemEvent`, `agentTurn`, and `postCompactionDelegate` payloads against addressable sessions in the same gateway namespace. It is load-bearing for restart-recovered session deliveries and post-compaction delegate delivery; it is not the ordinary substrate for tool-path pending delegates before compaction.

**Queue idempotency.** The queue builds a sha256 entry id only when callers provide an idempotency key. Post-compaction delegate delivery builds that key from `sessionKey`, `compactionCount`, `firstArmedAt`/`createdAt`, sequence, and a task hash. Unkeyed enqueues remain UUID-backed and concurrent-distinct by default.

**Cross-host wire exposure.** The queue is local to one gateway. Exposing cross-session enqueue across gateway hosts would require a wire transport, auth/identity wrapper, and federation contract; this RFC deliberately does not specify that contract.

**Retry-cost interaction with `costCapTokens`.** Queue retry is substrate-native. A post-compaction delegate that retries before spawn does not consume continuation chain budget merely by being queued; the budget is charged only after `spawnSubagentDirect()` accepts the child and chain state is persisted.

**Substrate-cleanup contract.** Acked entries unlink at ack time within `ackSessionDelivery()`. Failed entries move into `failed/` via `moveSessionDeliveryToFailed()` and are pruned after 14 days by `pruneFailedOlderThan()`. Recovery and drain paths run failed-record pruning behind the `lastGcAt` watermark to amortize directory scans. Enqueue also applies a `queueDir.maxFiles` soft cap through `countQueuedFiles()` and the typed `SessionDeliveryQueueOverflowError`. Per-session enqueue rate limiting remains out of scope until a concrete rogue-producer scenario requires it.

## 4. Platform Integration

### 4.1 Two-layer compaction model and trigger taxonomy

OpenClaw compaction now operates across two complementary layers:

- **Initiated layer:** continuation features that allow the agent to notice pressure, prepare, and elect compaction.
- **Obligatory layer:** platform features that compact at hard boundaries and preserve a minimum mechanical summary.

The two-layer model is:

| Layer      | Components                                                                                    | Role                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Initiated  | context-pressure alerts, `continue_delegate()` with `post-compaction`, `request_compaction()` | agent-directed preservation of working state           |
| Obligatory | overflow compaction, `memoryFlush`, `postCompactionSections`                                  | platform-directed preservation when limits are crossed |

The continuation contribution can also be described as trigger causes plus emission surfaces:

| Trigger                   | Type                 | Who decides         | Source                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A: overflow               | reactive automatic   | platform            | existing 100% context trigger                                        |
| B: timeout + high usage   | reactive automatic   | platform            | existing idle-timeout path; disabled by `idleTimeoutSeconds: 0`      |
| C: `/compact`             | manual               | user                | existing slash command                                               |
| D: context-pressure       | proactive advisory   | continuation system | `checkContextPressure()` in the reply pipeline                       |
| E: `request_compaction()` | initiated volitional | agent               | new tool-driven trigger                                              |
| F: mid-turn pressure-fire | reactive in-turn     | platform (in-turn)  | overflow / timeout-recovery emit path in `pi-embedded-runner/run.ts` |

Triggers A–C predate this work. Triggers D and E are the continuation additions. **Trigger F** is not a new compaction _cause_ — it is the in-turn emission shape that the existing Trigger A (overflow) and Trigger B (timeout + high usage) paths take when they fire from inside `pi-embedded-runner/run.ts` rather than from the pre-run `checkContextPressure()` gate. It is named separately because it is what operators grep for: A and B emit a `[context-pressure:fire] mid-turn trigger=overflow` / `mid-turn trigger=timeout` log anchor in the same format as the pre-run band fires, plus a `[system:context-pressure]` system event to the session, so a single grep across the `[context-pressure:fire]` anchor surfaces both pre-run (D) and in-turn (F) compaction events. Trigger F is therefore a _convergent emission_ of Triggers A and B, not an independent decision path; it is the human-user-visible name for the thing that lets one grep find every mid-turn compaction that bypassed the pre-run pressure check.

```

Code anchors for Trigger F: `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.ts:1085` (overflow recovery emit), the timeout-recovery emit a few hundred lines up in the same file, and regression guards in `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.overflow-compaction.loop.test.ts:96` and `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run.timeout-triggered-compaction.test.ts:105` that pin the shared anchor format across both paths.

### 4.2 Context-pressure awareness

The continuation system adds a system event that reports session pressure before compaction becomes unavoidable.

A representative configuration is:

```yaml
agents:
  defaults:
    continuation:
      contextPressureThreshold: 0.8
      earlyWarningBand: 0.3125
```

When the session crosses the threshold, the gateway enqueues a message such as:

```text
[system:context-pressure] 85% context consumed (170k/200k tokens).
Consider evacuating working state to memory files or delegating remaining work.
```

The event is injected **pre-run**, not post-run. That distinction matters: the agent can act in the current turn rather than discovering pressure one turn too late.

The message is telemetry, but it is also lifecycle instruction. At low pressure it can establish a habit of steady evacuation: write durable state, dispatch a quiet `continue_delegate(mode="post-compaction")`, or send a silent shard that preserves the detail most likely to matter after the window changes. At rising pressure it should make evacuation the live concern of the turn. At high pressure it should make elective `request_compaction()` preferable to waiting for the platform to force compaction at the boundary.

This is the practical form of the lich pattern from §2.5. The session is not merely warned that it is getting large; it is given time to arrange the recovery payload it wants to meet after compaction. The payload can be a file, a staged delegate, a silent return, or any other bounded provision the successor session can inherit.

Urgency is banded. `contextPressureThreshold` is optional; when absent, ordinary pre-run pressure events are disabled. `earlyWarningBand` is shipped and defaults to `0.3125`, so a production threshold of `0.8` also creates an early warning at 25% (`0.8 * 0.3125`).

The practical bands are:

- early-warning threshold (25% with the shipped default multiplier and an 80% primary threshold),
- configured primary threshold (often 80% in production configurations),
- 90%,
- 95%.

The dedup rule is equality-based: the same band does not fire twice consecutively, but a new band always fires. This allows post-compaction lifecycles to begin again at lower bands without suppressing fresh advisories.

**Precondition: session token accounting.** The pre-fire check runs only when the reply pipeline has populated the current session's token count for the turn. Specifically, the reply-pipeline call site at `src/auto-reply/reply/agent-runner.ts` (via `checkSessionContextPressure` in `src/auto-reply/continuation/context-pressure.ts`) gates the entire pressure check on **four conditions all holding**:

1. **`contextPressureThreshold`** is configured (non-null) and positive (`> 0`). Absent or non-positive threshold disables the gate entirely. (Post-compaction-only path uses a default of `0.8` if unset.)
2. **`contextWindow`** resolves to a positive finite value (`> 0` and `Number.isFinite`).
3. **`activeSessionEntry.totalTokens`** is populated, finite, and positive (`> 0`).
4. **(non-post-compaction only)** **`activeSessionEntry.totalTokensFresh !== false`** — i.e., the cached token count is not explicitly stale. Note the asymmetry: an undefined `totalTokensFresh` passes through (treated as fresh-by-default); only an explicit `false` blocks. This is the staleness guard: when an upstream cost-accounting refresh is in flight and the in-memory `totalTokens` is known-stale, `totalTokensFresh: false` short-circuits the pre-fire check rather than firing on a stale ratio.

If any of conditions 1–3 fails, or condition 4 fails on the non-post-compaction path, the pre-fire check is a no-op for that turn. The next turn picks it up once the missing or stale value resolves.

**Post-compaction asymmetry.** The `postCompaction` flag bypasses condition 4 entirely (the staleness guard does not apply): post-compaction always fires once even on stale-count, since the post-compaction event is informational about the lifecycle event rather than threshold-band-driven. Conditions 1–3 still apply on the post-compaction path; only the staleness guard is asymmetric.

Operators investigating a "no band≥1 fires observed" pattern in a deployed fleet should first check, in order: (a) is `contextPressureThreshold` set and positive in the resolved config? (b) is `contextWindow` populated for the session-class? (c) is `totalTokens` populated at the call site? (d) is `totalTokensFresh` explicitly `false` (vs undefined)? A silent short-circuit at any of these points is distinguishable from a threshold-configuration issue only via the `[context-pressure:noop]` debug breadcrumbs (§6.1) or instrumentation at the call site.

### 4.3 `request_compaction()` in the compaction lifecycle

`request_compaction()` fills the gap that appears when `idleTimeoutSeconds: 0` removes the timeout-based compaction path. Some provider and proxy configurations need that setting, so compaction cannot depend only on idle timeout.

When Trigger B is disabled, a session can climb from “still usable” to overflow with no proactive intervention unless D and E exist. Context-pressure warnings tell the agent when to prepare; `request_compaction()` lets it choose the lifecycle boundary after preparation is complete.

`request_compaction()` therefore does three things:

1. gives the agent a tool to compact after it has written memory files or staged post-compaction delegates;
2. routes into the same compaction machinery already used by platform compaction;
3. preserves the existing user-visible model in which compaction occurs between turns rather than freezing a live reply.

The tool applies two guards:

| Guard         | Threshold                                  | Purpose                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context floor | below 70% rejected                         | prevents wasteful compaction                                                      |
| Rate limit    | success-only cooldown, max 1 per 5 minutes | prevents compaction loops while allowing retry after failed background compaction |

Operational flow:

```text
1. context-pressure event fires
2. agent writes files and stages post-compaction work
3. agent calls request_compaction()
4. current turn finishes normally
5. compaction runs between turns
6. after-compaction path releases staged delegates
7. successor session resumes with boot files, summary, and enrichment
```

The behavioral impact is small at the API boundary and large at the lifecycle boundary: the agent can compact after it has saved what matters, instead of discovering after the fact that the platform compacted while the turn was still choosing what mattered.

**Shipped behavior:** volitional compaction must use the active session provider, model, and auth context. If background compaction resolves as `{ ok: true, compacted: true }`, the per-session cooldown is armed and the diagnostic `volitional` counter increments. Failed or rejected background compaction does not arm cooldown; instead, the tool emits `[system:compaction-failed]` telling the agent that evacuated state was not compacted and staged post-compaction delegates remain pending.

### 4.4 Continuation relay and post-compaction context rehydration

Before a first-class same-session continuation primitive existed, operators discovered a reliable workaround: export the next piece of work to a child session and let the child’s completion wake the parent later. This RFC refers to that historical pattern as a **continuation relay**.

> Historical analogy: the precursor pattern resembled storing state externally before interruption and restoring it afterward. The analogy is useful only for topology. In this document the technical terms are **continuation relay** for the precursor dispatch pattern and **post-compaction context rehydration** for the recovery path after compaction.

The relay pattern proved the need for `continue_work()`, but it also clarified what compaction-aware continuation required:

| Property             | Continuation relay precursor       | `continue_work()`        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Session overhead     | new child session per continuation | same session             |
| Context boundary     | warm but discontinuous             | continuous               |
| Latency              | child startup plus execution       | configurable delay only  |
| Observability        | spread across sessions             | one chain in one session |
| Role in final design | precursor and fallback pattern     | first-class primitive    |

A lighter precursor also existed: `requestHeartbeatNow()` could ring the parent session like a doorbell, but it still lacked task payload, chain tracking, and typed continuation semantics.

For `post-compaction` delegates, the release semantics are intentionally fixed: staged work is delivered as silent-wake work. Release does not mean "spawn already happened"; the after-compaction path first consumes staged delegates, drops stale work older than the TTL, applies the combined `maxDelegatesPerTurn` budget, enqueues accepted delegates into `session-delivery-queue`, and then drains that queue asynchronously.

If enqueueing fails, the affected delegate is re-staged for a later attempt. If draining fails, the queue retry path owns backoff and eventual failure movement. The lifecycle event reports queued and dropped counts, not guaranteed child-spawn counts. **Custody revision:** the drain retries only a failure that happened before the Gateway dispatch began. A started spawn attempt that a restart or an error leaves unproven ends in one `[continuation:delegate-spawn-interrupted]` notice, never a second spawn (Q3, §5.4.4). An entry that carries no attempt record ends in the same notice without a spawn.

**Custody revision.** Post-compaction release is part of **delegate custody**, not of `request_compaction()`. `request_compaction()` never crossed TaskFlow, and nothing about it changes. The staged record is a `post_compaction` record in the continuation custody store. Release is one state-database transaction that does three things: it inserts the `postCompactionDelegate` entry into `delivery_queue_entries` under an idempotency key derived from the record ID, it marks the record handed off (`succeeded` with a `handoff` to the queue entry, §5.4.2), and it keeps its attachment reference until the queue entry settles. At C the same handoff took three steps: claim the TaskFlow row, enqueue it separately, then finish the row at claim revision + 1, with restart recovery matching `pendingPostCompactionSourceKey(sessionKey, flowId)`. The single transaction removes that crash window. Upstream already writes a queue entry and a registry row in one worker transaction, in `subagent-completion-admission.worker.ts:admitSubagentCompletionInWorker@4d8c9bdd`. A failed enqueue still re-stages, because the transaction commits nothing. `awaitingNextCompaction` keeps its meaning: a record claimed for the next compaction seam is requeued at startup rather than released.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Staged: continue_delegate(mode="post-compaction")
    Staged --> Persisted: custody store post_compaction record
    Persisted --> Persisted: diagnostic sample totalQueued / pendingRunnable / stagedPostCompaction
    Persisted --> Compaction: platform or request_compaction fires
    Compaction --> Released: after_compaction consumes staged work
    Released --> Queued: one transaction enqueues postCompactionDelegate delivery and marks the record handed off
    Queued --> Draining: drainPendingSessionDeliveries()
    Draining --> Draining: diagnostic sample drained / failed rates + queueDepthHistory

    SuccessorTurn --> SuccessorTurn: run.started fireReason=continuation-chain
    Draining --> Retry: failure before the Gateway dispatch began
    Retry --> Queued: backoff eligible
    Retry --> Failed: retry cap exceeded
    Draining --> Interrupted: started attempt left unproven, or entry enqueued before the cutover (Q3)
    Interrupted --> Failed: one delegate-spawn-interrupted notice, no second spawn
    Released --> Dropped: stale TTL or maxDelegatesPerTurn overflow
    Released --> ReStaged: enqueue failure
    ReStaged --> Persisted: preserve for later compaction
```

The post-compaction rehydration path consists of three layers:

1. **Immediate lifecycle signal:** `[system:post-compaction]` establishes that compaction occurred.
2. **Queued continuity signal:** staged post-compaction work and queued post-compaction delivery indicate that asynchronous returns may still be in flight.
3. **Persistent files:** configured workspace sections, memory files, and `RESUMPTION.md` (a deployment convention, not a platform feature) preserve the durable working summary.

What survives compaction today:

- system events and staged metadata in session storage,
- files written to disk,
- post-compaction delegate staging.

What does not survive in full:

- detailed conversational context beyond the compaction summary,
- associative working-state “temperature” that was held only in the active prompt,
- some chain metadata that is intentionally reset by lifecycle boundaries.

The role of staged delegates is therefore not merely to preserve facts, but to restore active working shape after the lifecycle reset.

Post-compaction context rehydration reads `AGENTS.md` through boundary-file protections, rejects symlink/hardlink escapes, extracts configured sections, substitutes `YYYY-MM-DD` with the current date in the human-user's timezone, appends a runtime current-time line, and truncates to the configured per-agent post-compaction context limit. If that context read fails, the system emits `[continuation:post-compaction-context-read-failed]` and a `[system:post-compaction]` warning so the successor turn sees the missing-context condition.

### 4.5 Lifecycle hooks and platform settings

The continuation system integrates with existing compaction hooks and settings rather than replacing them.

Hooks used directly:

| Hook                | Type    | Usage                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `before_compaction` | observe | capture pre-compaction diagnostics such as token count, delegate count, and chain depth                                                            |
| `after_compaction`  | observe | emit `[system:post-compaction]`, inject workspace boot files via `readPostCompactionContext()`, clear staged delegates, and dispatch released work |

Platform settings used in interoperation:

| Setting                              | Platform role                    | Continuation interaction                                                            |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compaction.memoryFlush.enabled`     | mechanical summary preservation  | provides the floor below intentional delegate-based preservation                    |
| `compaction.postCompactionSections`  | static section re-injection      | arrives alongside dynamic delegate returns                                          |
| `compaction.truncateAfterCompaction` | session log cleanup              | affects conversation history, not session metadata or staged delegate state         |
| `llm.idleTimeoutSeconds`             | timeout-based compaction trigger | when set to `0`, removes Trigger B and increases the importance of Triggers D and E |

The interop invariant is simple: disabling continuation restores ordinary platform compaction behavior without semantic changes.

### 4.6 Gateway as lifecycle broker

The continuation primitives — `continue_work`, `continue_delegate`, `request_compaction` — are the prior art for a discipline this RFC names explicitly: **the agent owns intent, the tool owns mechanics, the substrate owns durability.**

**Substrate-adoption rule (default bias) — verbs over upstream nouns.** Where the upstream cross-session addressable enrichment substrate (see §3.6) can carry a concern cleanly, prefer it over bespoke transport. Bespoke pathing is acceptable only where a **concrete direct or transitive functional reason** is named — a function whose semantics the substrate genuinely cannot carry, a lifecycle mismatch the substrate cannot express, or an integration cost the substrate cannot amortize. _Seam-ugliness alone does not clear this bar_; the exception requires a named functional gap, not aesthetic discomfort. The shorthand: _describe what the agent wants done (the verb), let the tool route to the substrate that already names the noun_. Bespoke transport in the presence of a fitting substrate, without a named functional reason, is a review-rejectable design choice on this RFC.

**Audit shape at any seam.** A seam audit under this rule produces _evidence_, not doctrine: it answers _"can the substrate carry this concern cleanly, or is there a concrete functional reason X it cannot"_ — and then either adopts the substrate (no exception earned) or documents the exception with the named X. Outcome labels for a given seam (e.g. "always-queue", "queue-with-bespoke-fallback", "bespoke-only") are useful coordination handles after the audit, but they are _not_ the governing axis; the rule above is.

**Enforcement.** Enforcement is by review against this section. Bespoke transport remains possible when it names a functional reason. **Custody revision:** the TaskFlow substrate is replaced by the continuation custody store (pre-admission) and the subagent registry (post-admission). The seam audit for that choice is §5.4.3.

The agent supplies structured intent (`delaySeconds`, `mode`, `reason`, task, and optional return targets); the tool's code path picks the substrate (continuation custody store, process hedge timer, `session-delivery-queue`, or the subagent registry after handoff, see §3.6), the lifecycle hook (compaction-pending vs. immediate dispatch, see §4.5), and the wire (same-host session addressing today, cross-host addressing only when supported). The agent never names a substrate, hook, or wire — those are the tool's job.

```

**Brokered surface.** The `tool-result-middleware` extension becomes the brokered seam for results returning from these three primitives: a single seam, three primitives, deterministic mechanics underneath. `src/agents/harness/native-hook-relay.ts` replaces the previous PTY-scraping pattern-match pipeline with structured lifecycle-hook subscription for downstream consumers; this is the runtime expression of the brokered-seam discipline.

**Worked example — `continue_delegate(task, mode, delaySeconds?)`.**

| Layer     | Owns                                                                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Agent     | `task`, `mode` (`silent` / `silent-wake` / `post-compaction`), `delaySeconds`, optional return target  |
| Tool      | custody-store enqueue/stage, hedge timer, target resolution, custody handoff, span emission (§6.6)     |
| Substrate | path-specific persistence and retry: custody-store record, `subagent_runs` row, or queue record (§3.6) |

**The discipline this section asserts.** Future tool-surface designs in the openclaw repo SHOULD cite §4.6 as the doctrine. They SHOULD NOT duplicate the boundary-line analysis per-surface; they SHOULD declare the agent/tool/substrate owns-table for their primitive and link back here for the rationale. New surfaces that violate the discipline (agent naming the substrate, or tool exposing substrate-internal retry semantics to the agent) are review-rejectable on this RFC alone.

## 5. Configuration

### 5.1 Core configuration surface

The shipped configuration surface is consolidated below.

```yaml
agents:
  defaults:
    continuation:
      enabled: false # feature ships disabled by default
      maxChainLength: 10
      defaultDelayMs: 15000
      minDelayMs: 5000
      maxDelayMs: 300000
      costCapTokens: 500000
      maxDelegatesPerTurn: 5
      crossSessionTargeting: disabled
      contextPressureThreshold: 0.8 # optional; omit to disable ordinary pre-run pressure events
      earlyWarningBand: 0.3125 # multiplier against contextPressureThreshold; 0 disables early warning
      busySkipBackoff: # optional; busy-skip re-arm rate-cap (NOT a safety invariant)
        baseMs: 1000 # first re-arm delay; default 1000
        ceilingMs: 300000 # give-up rate-cap; default = maxDelayMs (flow never dropped, just slows)
        factor: 2 # exponential growth per consecutive busy-skip; default 2, must be > 1
      orphanReapStaleCutoffMs: 7200000 # optional; orphan-reap confidence-gate floor; default = subagent stale cutoff (2h)
```

Operational notes:

- `enabled: false` means explicit opt-in is required in `openclaw.json`.
- `maxChainLength` is a recursion guard bounding _unattended self-continuation chain depth_. The chain-count resets to zero on any non-continuation turn-entry (genuine user input, heartbeat, or external system event), so the guard bounds only one unbroken self-driven burst between human (or external) re-engagements, not session-lifetime budget. See §3.3 for the chain-state lifecycle.
- `costCapTokens` is a per-chain token-cost leash accumulating across `continue_work()` and tool-path delegate hops within a single unbroken self-continuation chain. The accumulated chain tokens reset to zero on the same non-continuation turn-entry trigger as `continuationChainCount`, keeping the cap as a per-burst guard rather than a session-lifetime quota.
- `crossSessionTargeting: disabled` is the default-deny gate for explicit cross-session delegate return targeting.
- `contextPressureThreshold` is optional and must be `> 0` and `<= 1` when configured.
- `earlyWarningBand` is shipped, defaults to `0.3125`, accepts `0` as opt-out, and is schema-validated as a unit-interval value.
- `busySkipBackoff` tunes the consecutive busy-skip re-arm: a continuation wake that finds its session busy (`requests-in-flight`/`draining`) re-arms after `baseMs`, growing by `factor` per consecutive busy-skip up to `ceilingMs`. This is a RATE-cap (give-up = rate-cap-forever): the flow is never dropped, it just polls more slowly and delivers the instant the session quiets. All three fields are optional positive values (`factor > 1`); defaults are `1000` / `maxDelayMs` / `2`. It is not a safety invariant.
- `orphanReapStaleCutoffMs` is the orphan-reap confidence-gate floor: a busy-deferred delegate flow whose parent subagent run is CONFIDENT-terminal (explicit `endedAt`, or unended past this cutoff) is reaped rather than rate-capped forever. Unset uses the subagent-registry stale cutoff (2h); a per-run explicit timeout is always respected, so a run is never reaped before its own timeout plus grace. The safety invariants are fixed and NOT tunable: same-session work never reaps (delegate-flow-gate), uncertain liveness always quiesces, and a wrongful reap never happens.
- There is no `generationGuardTolerance` setting. Delayed work is not cancelled by unrelated channel noise.
- tool-path delegate durability is unconditional; there is no delegate-store switch.
- all shipped continuation runtime values are read at use time; changes take effect at the next enforcement point.
- `subagents.maxChildrenPerAgent` (default: 5, schema ceiling: 10000) controls concurrent active children per parent session. This interacts with continuation knobs: `maxDelegatesPerTurn` gates how many delegates a single turn can EMIT; `maxChildrenPerAgent` gates how many can be ACTIVE simultaneously; `maxChainLength` + `costCapTokens` bound the unattended self-continuation-chain recursion depth and token budget (both reset on fresh non-continuation turn-entry per §3.3). For wide-fanout patterns (large-scale fan-out, batch distribution, parallel research), override via `agents.defaults.subagents.maxChildrenPerAgent` in openclaw.json. Hot-reload: config is read at spawn-time (no caching, no restart needed).

#### Chain budget lifecycle

Both `maxChainLength` and `costCapTokens` budgets accumulate _within an unbroken self-continuation chain_ and reset to zero on the first non-continuation turn-entry (`!isContinuationWake` gate at turn-entry, pre-inference, before `loadContinuationChainState` reads the SessionEntry). A "chain" is the run of self-elected successor turns from `continue_work` / `continue_delegate` between two human (or external) re-engagements; the budgets bound the unattended-loop depth and cost, not the session lifetime.

`/status` displays `chain N/maxChainLength` reflecting current chain depth, which **sawtooths**: climbs within an unbroken self-chain, drops to 0 the moment a fresh chain starts (user message, heartbeat, system event). The default for `maxChainLength` thus reflects "how deep a single unattended self-loop can run before the gateway stops it," not "how many continuations a session gets in its lifetime."

Four fields reset together as a unit at the chain-break: `continuationChainCount`, `continuationChainTokens`, `continuationChainStartedAt`, and a freshly minted `continuationChainId`. The chain-id rotation ensures trace-correlation discriminates one self-continuation arc from the next. Only mid-chain continuation-wake turns preserve the accumulating chain state so a genuine runaway self-loop still hits the cap: `work-wake` and an in-chain `delegate-return` (a `[continuation:chain-hop:N]` return). Every other turn-entry resets — including an ordinary inter-session subagent completion, which is classified as `subagent-return` (not a mid-chain `delegate-return`) precisely so the reset fires for it.

**Methodological note for source-readers.** Static walks of `loadContinuationChainState`'s `?? 0` default-fallback or the `chainId` mint-ternary (`previousCount > 0 ? sameChain : newChain`) can mistakenly suggest a count-reset active-mechanism on chain-start. They are passive defaults / correlation-id mints — not active count-resets. The actual count-reset sites are the `!isContinuationWake` turn-entry hook (the chain-break reset shipped here) and `agent-runner-session-reset.ts` (the session-rotation reset for error-recovery paths). To find active reset sites, grep for literal `= 0` or `= undefined` assignments rather than reading default-fallback patterns.

### 5.2 Human-user profiles

#### Shipped defaults: single-agent, safety-first

```yaml
agents:
  defaults:
    continuation:
      enabled: false
      maxChainLength: 10
      maxDelegatesPerTurn: 5
      costCapTokens: 500000
      crossSessionTargeting: disabled
      contextPressureThreshold: 0.8
      earlyWarningBand: 0.3125
      minDelayMs: 5000
      maxDelayMs: 300000
```

This defaults to opt-in behavior with strict interruption semantics and a conservative per-chain budget.

#### Fleet multi-agent profile

```yaml
agents:
  defaults:
    continuation:
      enabled: true
      maxChainLength: 10
      maxDelegatesPerTurn: 20
      costCapTokens: 1000000
      crossSessionTargeting: enabled
      defaultDelayMs: 15000
      minDelayMs: 5000
      maxDelayMs: 300000
      contextPressureThreshold: 0.8
      earlyWarningBand: 0.3125
    subagents:
      maxChildrenPerAgent: 1000
```

This profile is suitable for multiple persistent agents in shared channels. In that environment:

- `maxDelegatesPerTurn: 20` enables wide fan-out;
- `costCapTokens: 1000000` preserves a budget ceiling while permitting broad but shallow work;
- `subagents.maxChildrenPerAgent: 1000` permits wide continuation-delegate fan-out without hitting the per-session children cap (continuation token-budget + chain-length stay primary runaway-safety; per-session children cap is a complementary floor for non-continuation interactive spawn-safety).

Adjust fan-out and budget based on the activity level and agent count in the target channel.

### 5.3 Wide fan-out patterns

A common fleet pattern is wide sensor fan-out:

```text
main session
  → coordinator delegate
    → sensor 1 reads chunk 1
    → sensor 2 reads chunk 2
    → sensor 3 reads chunk 3
    → ... up to maxDelegatesPerTurn
  → coordinator synthesizes and returns
```

Representative use cases:

- document chunking and synthesis,
- parallel research queries,
- ambient monitoring with `silent` returns,
- codebase scans across multiple scoped delegates.

In these patterns, width is normally adjusted before depth. `costCapTokens` remains the primary global safety mechanism.

With explicit return targets, any leaf can return to the root, its coordinator, another owner session, the ancestor tree, or every known same-host session. `silent` makes the return ambient context, `silent-wake` makes it an immediate turn grant, and `fanoutMode` decides how far the signal travels.

#### Cross-session targeting policy

Explicit cross-session delegate targeting — `targetSessionKey`, `targetSessionKeys`, and `fanoutMode: "all"` — is gated by `agents.defaults.continuation.crossSessionTargeting`.

| Value                  | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"disabled"` (default) | Delegates can return to the dispatching session or use `fanoutMode: "tree"` for lineage-only routing. Explicit cross-session targeting (`targetSessionKey` to a non-self session, `targetSessionKeys` containing any non-self session, `fanoutMode: "all"`) is rejected. Self-targeting is always allowed. |
| `"enabled"`            | All targeting modes are available, including same-host `targetSessionKey`, `targetSessionKeys`, and `fanoutMode: "all"`.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The gate addresses the model-controlled cross-session context-injection surface: without it, a continuation-enabled session can affect unrelated sessions on the same host. With the gate default-deny, operators explicitly opt in to cross-session targeting when their deployment model requires it. Enforcement is live-read at tool validation, durable delegate dispatch, post-compaction delegate release, and bracket-syntax spawn, so a config reload changes the next enforcement point without restarting the gateway.

### 5.4 Continuation custody after the TaskFlow removal

<a id="54-taskflow-backing-for-same-session-work-and-delegates" />

Up to C (`7b3815d7`), TaskFlow backed three kinds of continuation state: same-session `continue_work` elections, pending delegates from both the tool and the token form, and post-compaction staging. Upstream removed the Tasks/TaskFlow runtime in openclaw/openclaw#159179 (`6652f7eac8`) with no compatibility facade. This section is the design of record for the custody that replaces it. It keeps the public continuation contract. A design review approved the architecture and decided these questions on 2026-09-29:

- **Q1.** The custody authority is a continuation-owned table in the shared state database, written through state-worker operations (option E, §5.4.3).
- **Q2.** The spawn owner accepts an internal launch idempotency key, so continuation records the child run ID before it spawns (§5.4.4).
- **Q3.** A delegate claim whose outcome is uncertain ends in a visible interruption notice and is never re-spawned (at-most-once, §5.4.4).
- **Q4.** Upstream is asked to register native spawns in `subagent_runs` before acknowledging them (§5.4.4, Appendix E).
- **Q5.** `chainId` stays out of the owner condition (§5.4.3).
- **Q6, Q7.** Rulings for importing stored TaskFlow rows (inline-byte scrub, downgrade fencing). No import ships here (§5.4.5).
- **Q8.** No public listing surface is restored (§5.4.6).

The continuation keeps its §5.1 non-configurability. Durability is still unconditional, but for delegates it now ends at the claim (Q3, §5.4.4): queued work survives restart until it is claimed, and a claim that a restart leaves unresolved ends in a visible interruption, not a replay. Process hedge timers still only prompt drains of durable records. Upstream citations in this section are `path:symbol@4d8c9bdd`.

#### 5.4.1 Upstream facts the design stands on

- **`flow_runs` survives, but nothing uses it.** The table is still created, but no production code reads it. Upstream's storage docs say its rows remain _"untouched and unused by the runtime"_ and are _"not converted into a replacement ledger"_ (`docs/reference/database-schemas/layout.md`, `versioning.md`).
- **Retained owners hold their own rows.** Cron owns its `runtime = 'cron'` history rows; subagent custody is `subagent_runs`; session-addressed durable replay is `delivery_queue_entries`.
- **Database access rules.** Runtime database access runs in worker threads. Writers use the state worker broker (`runOpenClawStateWorkerOperation`) with a synchronous `runOpenClawStateWriteTransaction` inside the worker. Transactions contain no `await` and reread authoritative rows before writing.
- **Adding a table** needs no schema-version bump, but it triggers the storage review checkpoint (`docs/reference/database-schemas/storage-changes.md`).
- **Restart doctrine for children.** `recoverInterruptedSubagentRow` finalizes a child interrupted by a Gateway restart as an error: _"Old launch receipts are evidence of uncertain effects, never permission to replay a child."_

#### 5.4.2 Requirement 1: the full durable replay state and its new home

**Owner.** All continuation custody lives in one **continuation custody store**: the continuation-owned `continuation_records` table in the shared state database (§5.4.3). It is a first-use table (`FIRST_USE_STATE_TABLES`), created at the first continuation write, because task text and reasons are privacy-sensitive. Continuation code in `src/auto-reply/continuation/` is its only writer. Reads go through the read-only worker scope and writes through a continuation state-worker operation family; nothing reads the table directly.

**Columns.**

**Work state** (`PendingWorkStateSchema`) keeps every field it had at C:

- **Identity and routing:** `kind`, `sessionKey`, `hop`, `reason`, `parentRunId`, `originRunId`, `originTurnId`, `traceparent`, `traceparentProvenance`. `originRunId`/`originTurnId` gate rollback ownership and anchor finalization; `parentRunId` exists only for the orphan-reap liveness join.
- **Chain and cost snapshot:** `maxChainLength`, `chainStartedAt`, `accumulatedChainTokens`, `chainId`. The live chain counters stay on the `SessionEntry` (§3.3).
- **Timing clocks:** `delayMs`, `electedAt`, `dueAt`, `anchorPending`, `anchorFinalizedAt`, `recoveryDueAt`, `releasedAt`. Anchor finalization is one CAS write. A retry never mutates semantic `dueAt`; it writes only `recoveryDueAt`. `releasedAt` is audit only.
- **Retry and busy-defer:** `retryCount` (limit 8) and `busySkipCount`, feeding `busySkipBackoff` (§5.1).
- **Idle arming:** `idleRetry { trigger, reasonCategory, armedAt }`. Queued records with `trigger = "reply-run-ended"` are the **parked** records that an election may supersede (§5.4.3).
- **Delivered marker and disposition:** `succeeded { point, durability }`, `deliveredAt`, `turnGrantedAt`, `foldedAt`, `overdueByMs`, `disposition`. The durable delivered mark is written while the record is still `running` and prevents a restart-gap duplicate turn. Consume, recovery peek, idle retry and the live-work check all treat it as done.

**Delegate and post-compaction state** (`PendingDelegateStateSchema`, strict):

- **Identity, mode and timing:** `task`, `originRunId` (replay dedupe and `failQueuedDelegatesOwnedByRun`), `model`, `traceparent`, `traceparentProvenance`, `silent`, `silentWake`, `postCompaction`, `inheritedSilent`, `inheritedWake`, `delayMs`, `firstArmedAt`, `releasedAt`. The due time stays `created_at + delayMs`.
- **Target and authority:** `targetSessionKey`, `targetSessionKeys`, `fanoutMode`, `recipientAuthorityBinding`. At the handoff these move, in upstream's registration commit, to the continuation fields of the `SubagentRunRecord` (`continuationTargetSessionKey(s)`, `continuationFanoutMode`, `continuationRecipientAuthorityBinding`, `silentAnnounce`, `wakeOnReturn`, `traceparent`), where return routing reads them.
- **Return covenant:** `returnOptions`, `recipientContext`. At spawn the return-claim store captures the immutable artifact policy (§A.6).
- **Chain state:** `chainTokensFold`, `persistedChainState`, `persistedChainStateKind`. The planned-persist marker exists because the `SessionEntry` (per-agent database) and the custody store (shared state database) cannot share a transaction; it stops recovery from advancing the chain twice.
- **Child-session handoff:** an explicit `spawnAttempts[]` list (`{attemptId, childRunId, claimedAt}`) and a `handoff` object (`{target: "subagent_runs", childRunId, childSessionKey, handedOffAt}`), the idempotent handoff key of §5.4.4. `spawnAttempts[]` is kept after terminalization as evidence.
- **Attachments:** `attachmentId` and `attachmentCount`. The bytes live in a private payload file, `<stateDir>/attachments/continuation-custody/<attachmentId>/payload.json` (8 MiB cap), which binds `recordId` (read as `flowId` for v1 payloads) and `ownerKey`. Release rules are in §5.4.4.
- **Post-compaction staging:** `awaitingNextCompaction`. The handoff is explicit: `handoff = {target: "session_delivery_queue", queueEntryId, handedOffAt}`, committed with the queue insert (§4.4).
- **Legacy, accepted but never projected:** the `spawnRequester*` routing fields. Recovery rebinds to `owner_session_key`.

**Terminal-notice obligation.** `terminalNoticePending` in `state_json` names a notice the owning session is still owed: `"retry-exhausted"` for work, and `"delegate-spawn-interrupted"` for a delegate (§5.4.4). The notice's `delivery_queue_entries` insert and the obligation clear commit in **one** state-database transaction, under an idempotency key derived from `record_id`, so exactly one notice is delivered. Retention never prunes a record while the obligation is set (§5.4.6).

**Transition atomicity.** Every single-record transition is a CAS on `revision`, serialized through the state worker broker's FIFO: claim, anchor, requeue, grant/fold finish, delivered mark, fail, interrupted-spawn terminalization, cancel request, scrub, chain-persist plan, and policy annotation. Three transitions are multi-record transactions:

- election with parked-work replacement (§5.4.3);
- terminal-notice enqueue plus clear;
- post-compaction release plus queue insert.

**Work-scheduling rollback.** Undoing an election whose electing turn failed to finalize is a multi-record CAS with no owner condition. It uses an explicit `rollbackOf` marker rather than revision arithmetic, and restores superseded priors exactly (`phase`, state, cancel fence).

#### 5.4.3 Requirement 2: one transactional authority for election replacement

An election is one continuation state-worker operation running one synchronous write transaction. The transaction:

1. rereads the owner's live work records: `owner_session_key` = session, `kind` = `work`, `status IN (queued, running)`, `cancel_requested_at IS NULL`;
2. requires them to equal the caller's snapshot exactly, by `(recordId, revision, status)`;
3. requires each superseded parked record to still be at its expected revision;
4. requires the created record to be new;
5. writes all records.

Before the transaction runs, the caller rejects `running_owner` (an unexpected running record exists), `capped` (`maxPendingWork` or more non-parked queued records) and `invalid_prior`. A conflict retries once.

**Decided (Q5): no chain check.** `chainId` is copied into the new record, but it is not part of the owner condition. Ownership is session-wide across every live work record, whatever its chain; making chain identity a precondition would permit two live elections after a chain transition.

**Decided (Q1): a continuation-owned table in the shared state database, with timer and idle wakes as projections only.** Timer and idle wakes change nothing in the store; they only prompt a drain. The alternatives were rejected:

- **session pending inputs** are custody for an already admitted turn, have no due time, and are never replayed after a restart;
- **election state on the `SessionEntry`** lives in the per-agent database, so it cannot share a transaction with `delivery_queue_entries` or `subagent_runs`, and recovery would have to scan every agent database;
- **cron one-shot jobs** have no revision CAS, cannot deliver the trusted `[continuation:wake]` system event to an arbitrary session, and reorder work on restart catch-up;
- **`subagent_runs`** has no row for a same-session election or a pre-admission delegate;
- **reinterpreting `flow_runs`** would reverse upstream's "untouched and unused" contract for a table it abandoned.

Sharing the shared state database with the queue and the registry strengthens two contracts: the terminal-notice enqueue and clear become one commit, and so do the post-compaction release and queue insert. The custody handoff check can read `subagent_runs` inside the same transaction that marks a delegate handed off. Storage-review acceptance for the new table is part of this change (no version bump).

#### 5.4.4 Requirement 3: pre-spawn custody handoff to `subagent_runs`

**Two-phase custody.** `subagent_runs` cannot own a delegate before a child exists: a native spawn creates the child session, materializes attachments, dispatches the Gateway `agent` turn, and only then calls `registerSubagentRun` (`spawnSubagentDirect`, `runSpawnPipeline`). The custody store therefore owns the delegate before admission and the registry owns it after. The handoff needs a key both sides can see.

**Handoff key: a precomputed child run ID (decided, Q2).** The Gateway uses the caller's idempotency key as the run ID (`agent-request-preflight.ts`, `const runId = request.idempotencyKey`). `spawnSubagentDirect` accepts an explicit launch idempotency key for non-collector spawns and uses it verbatim. Continuation derives `childRunId = continuation:<recordId>:<attemptId>` and records it in the claim _before_ calling spawn, so once the child is admitted the registry row's `run_id` equals it and recovery can look it up by run ID. The change is bounded:

- **Internal parameter only.** The launch key is a spawn-owner parameter that continuation passes in process. The `sessions_spawn` tool schema does not gain it, and no model or client can supply it.
- **Reserved namespace.** `continuation:` run IDs are reserved for backend callers, as exec-approval follow-up keys already are: a non-backend `agent` request that uses one is rejected. The reservation is never weakened to accommodate a caller.
- **Collisions are not adoption.** Recovery hands a record off only to a registry row whose `run_id` equals a recorded `childRunId` **and** whose `requester_session_key` equals the record's `owner_session_key`. Any other match is a collision: recovery leaves the row untouched and terminalizes the record with the interrupted notice plus a structural collision diagnostic. Attempt IDs are never reused within a record.

**What moves at the handoff:**

- **Return routing and recipient authority** move into the registration commit as the `SubagentRunRecord` continuation fields.
- **Attachment custody.** Spawn materializes the bytes into the child's private receipt directory and the registry row records its own `attachmentId`. The continuation payload file is released only **after** the handoff is marked, or when the record terminalizes. A new attempt (see "In-process spawn failures") re-materializes from the retained payload, and spawn re-validates the bytes against the policy then in force (§9.2.1).
- **Chain charge** is applied once, at accept, guarded by the `persistedChainState` planned-persist marker (§5.4.2).

**Crash-boundary table.** "Recovery" is the Gateway startup continuation recovery, which runs after custody readiness (§5.4.5) and after upstream `activateSubagentRegistry`.

**Unresolved claims are at-most-once (decided, Q3).** Boundaries 2 and 3 cannot be told apart after a restart, and a delegate can edit files, publish, or send messages outside the session, so uncertain prior execution never permits a second child. That matches upstream's no-replay doctrine for children. The durability promise narrows accordingly: **queued work survives restart until it is claimed.** A claimed spawn that a restart left unresolved ends in one visible `[continuation:delegate-spawn-interrupted]` notice. The notice identifies the record, its attempts and their `childRunId`s, and the task, and states that admission could not be proven, so the owning agent can decide whether to issue a new delegate. That decision is a new, visible election; recovery never makes it. Because a missing row never licenses a spawn, registry row retention (`archiveAfterMinutes`) cannot cause a duplicate; it can at most make an admitted child look unresolved, which the notice wording covers. The handoff mark is written in the dispatch that saw spawn accepted and retried in process until it commits.

**In-process spawn failures.** Q3 covers uncertainty in general, not only across a restart. A requeue is kept only for a failure in spawn's `initialize` phase, before the Gateway dispatch (`runSpawnPipeline` tracks `initialize`, `dispatch` and `register`). A failure in the `dispatch` or `register` phase leaves execution uncertain, even when spawn's cleanup then terminates the accepted run, so the record is terminalized with the interrupted notice, as is any thrown error whose phase is unknown. A result that `spawnSubagentDirect` returns before the pipeline starts (an attachment-policy rejection or failed materialization) carries no `runId` and provably dispatched nothing: a policy rejection terminalizes with the rejection notice, and a transient failure requeues. Before a requeued record is claimed again, the dispatcher checks `subagent_runs` under every recorded `childRunId`; a row found there is a handoff (boundary 4), never a second spawn.

**Upstream closure of boundary 3 (decided, Q4).** The follow-up upstream change in Appendix E registers native `sessions_spawn` children in `subagent_runs` before the Gateway acknowledges the dispatch, as plugin subagents already do. Once it lands, a row under a recorded `childRunId` means admitted custody and no row means the Gateway never accepted the child, so boundary 3 disappears. Restoring a retry for boundary 2 would then be possible, but it is a separate policy decision; until then Q3's at-most-once policy stands.

**Reset at any boundary.** Explicit reset cancels records in states 1 and 2 (including a state 2 that was really state 3), scrubs their attachment references, and releases the payload files immediately. For states 4 to 6 it relies on upstream `stopSessionResetSubagents`, which kills the requester's child runs.

**Post-compaction handoff (queue drain).** Staging hands custody to the session delivery queue, not to the registry (§4.4). The `postCompactionDelegate` queue kind and its drain contract belong to continuation; upstream's own queue kinds are `systemEvent` and `agentTurn`. The drain spawns the child under the same rules:

- the queue payload carries a precomputed `childRunId` derived from `(recordId, queue attempt)`, so the drain can recompute every earlier attempt's key. The drain never spawns an entry without one;
- before it spawns, the drain persists attempt ownership with `markSessionDeliveryAttemptStarted`, which sets `deliveryStartedAt`. Once a spawn has begun, the drain never fails the entry with `releaseAttemptOwnership`, which would clear `deliveryStartedAt`; release is kept only for `initialize`-phase failures;
- on every delivery the drain first checks `subagent_runs` under the entry's `childRunId`s, and a row found there settles the entry as delivered;
- an entry with `deliveryStartedAt` set and no row is an unresolved claim. The drain does not spawn (Q3): it enqueues one `[continuation:delegate-spawn-interrupted]` notice to the owner session, under an idempotency key derived from the entry ID, and then settles the entry as failed. A crash between the two writes repeats the same decision, and the notice enqueue resolves to the same queue entry, so the notice stays single.

The `childRunId` payload field goes to storage review together with the new table.

#### 5.4.5 Requirement 4: stored continuation TaskFlow rows and custody readiness

Upstream never ran the continuation on TaskFlow, so no upstream installation holds continuation `flow_runs` rows, and this change ships no import for them. The continuation custody store starts empty, and `flow_runs` stays untouched and unused, as upstream's storage docs describe.

**Update behavior** (AGENTS "Updates always work"):

- Custody needs no migration step: `continuation_records` is created on first use, and a database without it reads as empty custody.
- **Custody readiness (phase A).** One worker transaction (`continuationCustody.readBootFacts`) reads the live set, and phase A hydrates the hot-path projection from it. Every custody command except that raw boot read awaits phase A first: every mutation, every list read (session reset, the authoritative cleanup guard, recovery) and every correctness count. A thrown read installs nothing, and the next command retries.
- Readiness belongs to one database lifetime, not a path. Closing the state database drops the projection and any in-flight readiness together and advances a per-path epoch, matched by identity key or canonical path, so a phase A that started before a close cannot publish. A database replaced at the same path is read afresh.

#### 5.4.6 Listing: mandatory internal list-by-owner, optional `tasks.*`

The **internal list-by-owner capability is mandatory**. Its consumers are:

- startup recovery (all live records by kind and status);
- session reset (all records for an owner);
- `/status` counts (§6.3);
- the metrics provider;
- the subagent cleanup and sweep guards (`hasLiveOrRecentlyDispatchedContinuationWork`, `failStagedPostCompactionDelegatesForCleanup`).

The continuation custody store provides it through read-only worker queries on the `(owner_session_key, kind, status)` and `(status, kind, due_at)` indexes. Synchronous hot-path guards need to know "does this session have live continuation work" without an `await`. They read a lifecycle-owned projection that the custody store's write operations update after commit, with explicit invalidation on each write. They never freshness-poll.

The projection answers `known` or `unknown` per owner. It is `unknown` before phase A hydrates it (§5.4.5, "Update behavior") and, for an owner, after a write whose outcome is unknown, until that owner's next committed fact. **A correctness decision never reads `unknown` as zero.** Empty-turn finalization, chain-hop allocation and the compaction release check use `resolveQueuedDelegateCounts`, which waits for phase A and otherwise reads the owner's committed rows. Chain-hop allocation needs that exact count; any guessed value would weaken the chain cap. Only display surfaces (`/status`, metrics) may show `unknown` as 0.

**Retention.** Terminal records are pruned after 7 days, which is TaskFlow's policy carried over. A record whose `terminalNoticePending` is set is never pruned. The prune runs in the startup recovery pass and on a lifecycle-owned interval that the custody store owns.

**Decided (Q8): no public listing surface.** The `tasks.*` gateway RPC and the task UI were removed upstream, and this revision restores neither and defines no UI contract. A future listing surface would need its own design decision and would be a continuation-owned read method over list-by-owner, never a revival of `tasks.*`.

#### 5.4.7 Durable obligation and the upstream native-child completion gap

The continuation's own durable obligation is `terminalNoticePending` in the custody store (§5.4.2). Upstream's completion obligation for children is separate and stays upstream's: per-child delivery state in the `subagent_runs` payload, admitted together with a queue entry (`admitSubagentCompletionInWorker`), and the durable requester settle wake. `accepted-session-spawn.ts` is not a durable obligation store (its receipts live in a process `WeakMap`). After the handoff (§5.4.4 boundary 5), delegate completions rely on upstream's obligation.

Upstream's #159179 leaves a known gap for unstamped or ambiguous legacy Codex-native completion records. Continuation delegates spawn through `spawnSubagentDirect`, so they are native OpenClaw subagents tracked in `subagent_runs` and that gap does not apply to them; the spawn-order window of §5.4.4 boundary 3 is a separate, narrower gap (Appendix E).

| 8   | Listing surface (optional)                                         | Not re-added (Q8); any future continuation-owned read method needs a new design decision (§5.4.6)                                                            |

#### 5.4.9 Contract changes

Behavior contracts this revision keeps unchanged: unconditional custody with no opt-out (what durability promises for a claimed delegate changes; see item 1); anchor and delay semantics; the delivered mark; fold-note delivery; the work retry-exhausted terminal notice; chain and cost accounting; targeting and recipient authority; attachment validation, limits, snapshot-by-value and scrub; post-compaction staging and release; reset as an interruption boundary; and `request_compaction()`.

These promises change:

1. **Delegate durability ends at the claim, and a delegate is spawned at most once (Q3).** Queued delegate work survives restart **until it is claimed**. A claimed delegate whose child was admitted is handed off, never re-spawned (boundary 4). A claim that a restart leaves unresolved (boundaries 2 and 3) ends in one durable `[continuation:delegate-spawn-interrupted]` notice, with its attempt and run-ID evidence kept. The same rule covers in-process spawn errors that leave admission unproven, post-compaction queue entries with an unproven started attempt, and post-compaction queue entries with no recorded attempt. A dropped delegate is visible to the owning agent, which may issue it again as a new election.
2. **Two handoffs become single commits:** post-compaction release plus queue insert, and terminal notice plus clear.
3. **The storage owner changes.** The records are no longer visible through TaskFlow registry queries, the `tasks.*` RPC or the task UI.
4. **Reset releases payload files immediately** instead of at the next startup.

The highest-risk behaviors are pinned by `src/auto-reply/continuation/custody-conjecture.scenario.test.ts`: atomic replacement under a crash, the delivered-mark and terminal-notice restart gaps, the pre-spawn handoff at each boundary above, and tool/token parity for work, delegate and post-compaction.

These anchors make the full pipeline grepable end to end.

**`[context-pressure:noop]` reason taxonomy** (debug-level, gated behind `log.isEnabled("debug")` to avoid hot-path string interpolation):

| `reason=`         | Meaning                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `window-zero`     | `contextWindow <= 0` — model context window not yet resolved for this turn                                      |
| `below-threshold` | `ratio < threshold` — pressure ratio below the configured trigger; logs raw 4dp ratio alongside rounded percent |
| `band-dedup`      | `band === previous` — same pressure band as the previous fire; suppressed to avoid repeat-event flood           |

**Privacy.** Continuation log anchors that include free-text agent payloads (`[continue_delegate:enqueue] task=…`, `[continuation:enrichment-return] …`) honor the `extensions/diagnostics-otel` content-capture redaction policy (see §6.6). Operators deploying with content-capture enabled should declare `task`, `enrichment`, and `reason` keys in their redaction policy configuration before enabling capture in production.

### 6.2 Lifecycle traces

Representative runtime traces are shown below.

**Delegate enqueue and spawn:**

```text
[continue_delegate:enqueue] session=agent:main silent=false silentWake=true delayMs=60000 task=check CI status
[continuation:delegate-pending] 1 delegate(s) registered for agent:main
... 60s later ...
[continuation:delegate-spawned] task=check CI status delay=60000ms session=agent:main
```

**Silent return and wake:**

```text
[continuation/silent-wake] wakeOnReturn=true target=agent:main silentAnnounce=true
[continuation:enrichment-return] CI is green, all 152 tests passing
```

**Post-compaction release:**

```text
[auto-compaction] Session compacted: <before>k → <after>k tokens
[continuation:compaction-delegate] Consuming 1 compaction delegate(s) — dispatching alongside boot files
```

**Chain depth and cost:**

```text
[continuation] Chain depth: 3/10, cost: 45000/500000 tokens
[continuation] Chain cost cap reached (502000 > 500000) — delegate rejected
```

**Generation-drift behavior:** delayed work is not cancelled merely because unrelated channel activity advances the session generation. Explicit reset or cancellation remains an interruption boundary.

### 6.3 `/status` continuation telemetry

When continuation is enabled and at least one field is non-zero, `/status` surfaces the continuation state in both the CLI status report and the Discord/agent `/status` reply:

```text
🔄 Continuation: chain 3/10 | 2 delegates pending | 1 post-compaction staged | volitional: 1
```

The render is gated on (a) continuation enabled in the resolved config, and (b) at least one of the four fields being non-zero. Both gates are unit-tested in `src/auto-reply/status.test.ts`. The `volitional: N` field reflects successful agent-initiated compactions, not attempted or failed compactions; see §4.3.

| Field                      | Source                                           | Meaning                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chain X/Y`                | `continuationChainCount` and `maxChainLength`    | current depth versus maximum                                                  |
| `Z delegates pending`      | custody-store `delegate` records (list-by-owner) | delayed or not-yet-spawned tool-path work                                     |
| `W post-compaction staged` | custody-store `post_compaction` records          | delegates waiting for the next compaction lifecycle event                     |
| `volitional: N`            | request-compaction counter                       | count of successful agent-initiated compactions observed in the last 24 hours |

### 6.4 Context-pressure telemetry

Band dedup is equality-based, so a lower band fires again after compaction and a hot-reloaded threshold changes future firing without a restart:

| Scenario                      | `band`   | `lastBand` | Fires? |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Below all thresholds          | 0        | 0          | No     |
| First crossing                | 25       | 0          | Yes    |
| Same band again               | 25       | 25         | No     |
| Escalation                    | 90 or 95 | lower band | Yes    |
| Post-compaction new lifecycle | 25       | 95         | Yes    |

The current wire injects `checkContextPressure()` in the reply pipeline (`src/auto-reply/reply/agent-runner.ts`, pre-run injection). Post-compaction band-0 events fire as specified. Higher-band pre-fire events depend on the §4.2 preconditions: sessions must cross the configured threshold, the model context window must be known, and token accounting must be fresh. The `[context-pressure:noop] reason=…` debug breadcrumbs documented in §6.1 distinguish threshold misses from accounting misses and dedup suppression.

### 6.5 Human-user observability and hot reload

Operators can observe continuation behavior without restart:

- timer fire and cancel events remain at info level;
- timer setup and drift accumulation can be demoted to debug level;
- config changes emit `gateway/reload config change applied`;
- runtime reads happen at use time rather than process start, so new values apply at the next enforcement point.

Hot-reload validation confirmed live changes to:

- `maxDelegatesPerTurn`,
- `maxChainLength`,
- `costCapTokens`,
- `contextPressureThreshold`,
- `earlyWarningBand`.

Hot-reload status:

- all shipped `agents.defaults.continuation` knobs listed in §5.1 resolve through runtime reads rather than process-start constants;
- `diagnostics.otel.captureContent` is a diagnostics configuration surface outside `agents.defaults.continuation`; operators can flip content capture without restarting the continuation scheduler;
- `session-delivery-queue.retry.cap` and `.backoffMs[]` are not shipped configuration keys; bounded retry policy is documented in §3.6 but the retry constants are currently code-owned;
- `continuation.preservationTier` is not a shipped configuration key; switching tools-first ↔ response-token ↔ disabled (per §2.7) is currently controlled by `continuation.enabled` plus tool policy, not a single tier knob.

The runtime-read-at-use-time invariant SHOULD extend to the remaining specification-target knobs when implemented: no in-flight delegate, queued retry, or staged post-compaction handoff should be invalidated by a hot-reload.

### 6.6 Chain-correlation via diagnostics-otel

**Implementation status.** The `continuation.*` span vocabulary below is the current shipped tracer contract. Span vocabulary, emission infrastructure, and OTel adapter wiring are live:

- **Tracer facade** — `src/infra/continuation-tracer.ts` defines the tracer abstraction and canonical span vocabulary (`continuation.work`, `continuation.work.fire`, `continuation.delegate.dispatch`, `continuation.delegate.fire`, `continuation.queue.enqueue`, `continuation.queue.drain`, `continuation.compaction.released`, `continuation.disabled`, `heartbeat`).
- **Emission call sites** — `src/auto-reply/reply/agent-runner.ts` and `src/auto-reply/reply/session-system-events.ts` invoke the tracer at lifecycle points such as accept, fire, drain, and release.
- **OTel adapter wiring** — `extensions/diagnostics-otel/src/service.ts` calls `setContinuationTracer(createContinuationOtelTracerAdapter())` when tracing is enabled, installing the OTel-backed concrete tracer. The adapter implementation lives at `extensions/diagnostics-otel/src/continuation-tracer-adapter.ts`. Production can emit `continuation.*` spans through the OTel SDK alongside the existing `openclaw.*` spans, and resets to the no-op default on plugin stop.

The `[continuation:*]` log anchors of §6.1 remain available as the always-on substrate; the OTel spans are the structured-trace surface for chain reconstruction.

The schema below documents the **shipped contract** that emitters and downstream consumers must agree on, not a future-state aspiration. New span kinds or attribute additions land via amended emitter call sites + adapter mappings; removals require a deprecation cycle to avoid breaking consumers reading historical traces.

**Span schema.** Current canonical span names and pinned attributes are:

| Span name                          | Core attributes                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `continuation.work`                | `delay.ms`, `chain.step.remaining`, optional `chain.id`, optional privacy-safe reason metadata (`reason.present`, `reason.length`, `reason.hash`, `reason.redacted`)             |
| `continuation.work.fire`           | `chain.id`, `chain.step.remaining`, `delay.ms`, `fire.deferred_ms`, optional privacy-safe reason metadata                                                                        |
| `continuation.delegate.dispatch`   | `delay.ms`, `chain.step.remaining`, `delegate.delivery`, optional `chain.id`, optional `delegate.mode`, optional privacy-safe reason metadata                                    |
| `continuation.delegate.fire`       | `chain.id`, `chain.step.remaining`, `delay.ms`, `fire.deferred_ms`, `delegate.delivery="timer"`, `delegate.mode`, optional privacy-safe reason metadata                          |
| `continuation.queue.enqueue`       | canonical vocabulary entry for enqueue-side instrumentation; consumers must not substitute the old `continuation.delegate.enqueue` name                                          |
| `continuation.queue.drain`         | `queue.drained_count`, `queue.drained_continuation_count`                                                                                                                        |
| `continuation.compaction.released` | `signal.kind="compaction-release"`, `compaction.released`, optional `compaction.id`                                                                                              |
| `continuation.disabled`            | `chain.step.remaining`, `disabled.reason`, `signal.kind`, `continuation.disabled=true`, optional `chain.id`, optional delegate attributes, optional privacy-safe reason metadata |
| `heartbeat`                        | `signal.kind="heartbeat"`, `heartbeat.id`, optional `chain.id`, optional `chain.step.remaining`, optional `continuation.disabled`, optional `disabled.reason`                    |

Continuation reason and delegate task text are not exported as raw span attributes. When present, emitters export only `reason.present`, original `reason.length`, a stable `reason.hash` over redacted text, and `reason.redacted` to indicate whether the shared tool-payload redactor changed the text before hashing.

The old `continuation.delegate.enqueue`, `continuation.delegate.spawn`, `continuation.delegate.return`, `continuation.compaction.requested`, `continuation.compaction.enqueued`, `continuation.compaction.completed`, and `continuation.context_pressure.fire` names are not the current shipped vocabulary.

**Propagation pattern.** The continuation-tracer surface carries W3C `traceparent` through `StartSpanOptions`. The diagnostics-otel adapter parses that value and uses it as the remote parent context under the `openclaw.continuation` tracer. System events and queued deliveries can carry `traceparent` metadata, so queue and successor-turn spans can be stitched to the producer trace when the metadata is present. Targeted delegate-return trace preservation is the remaining audit item called out in §3.3.

    Child->>Diag: run.started / run.completed fireReason + parentRunId
    Tracer->>Adapter: parse traceparent and set remote parent context
    Adapter-->>Adapter: emit span under openclaw.continuation
```

**Tier visibility.** The current contract does not promise equivalent spans for every capability tier. Tools-first paths emit the spans wired at their accept/fire/drain/release seams. Response-token fallback emits through the scheduler and queue seams it actually uses. Disabled/gated attempts emit `continuation.disabled` spans, not a separate count metric.

**Privacy.** The `extensions/diagnostics-otel` content-capture controls gate per-key redaction. Continuation payloads SHOULD declare the following keys for redaction policy before content capture is enabled in production: `task`, `enrichment`, `reason`. These are the three free-text fields where agent prompts may carry user-content tails.

**Worked example — chain-locked-loop detection.** The chain-locked-loop failure mode, where agents self-elect `continue_work` chains from pre-compaction snapshots after the underlying state has moved on, surfaces in this schema as:

- `continuation.work` or `continuation.delegate.dispatch` spans whose `chain.step.remaining` decreases turn-over-turn,
- while the parent agent's `tool_call` spans stop referencing state that the rest of the deployment has moved past.

A trace-tree query over low `chain.step.remaining`, repeated continuation spans, and stale parent tool-call timestamps is sufficient to flag the latching condition. This RFC documents the schema, not the alerting policy.

### 6.7 OTEL trace wiring across the substrate queue boundary

**Specification target.** §6.6 defines the `continuation.*` span schema at the lifecycle boundary (enqueue/spawn/return). This subsection extends that schema **across the substrate queue boundary** used by system events, session delivery, and multi-recipient delegate return. Together with §6.6, the span schema, queue-lifecycle spans, and multi-recipient fan-out form future-work preparation: an observability substrate for an inter-node ringbuffer `station:stream` broadcast layer.

**Per-entry queue-lifecycle spans.** Each substrate-queue entry SHALL emit an OTEL span keyed to its lifecycle event:

| Span name                             | Emitted at                          | Required attributes                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `continuation.queue.enqueue.system`   | `enqueueSystemEvent`                | `kind`, `session`, `chainDepth`, `chainStepBudgetRemaining`        |
| `continuation.queue.enqueue.delivery` | `enqueueSessionDelivery`            | `target`, `session`, `chainDepth`, `chainStepBudgetRemaining`      |
| `continuation.queue.announce`         | `AnnounceQueueItem` drain           | `kind`, `target`, `dequeueLatencyMs`, `retryCount`                 |
| `continuation.queue.deliver`          | terminal delivery to target session | `target`, `outcome` (`accepted`\|`deferred`\|`dropped`), `reason?` |

The four spans form a single per-entry causal chain: `enqueue.{system,delivery}` → `queue.announce` → `queue.deliver`. This is the queue-side analog of the lifecycle-side continuation spans from §6.6, using the current `continuation.delegate.dispatch`, `continuation.delegate.fire`, and queue-drain vocabulary rather than the retired delegate enqueue/spawn/return names.

**`traceparent` propagation across the queue boundary.** The substrate queue is an asynchronous boundary: the enqueue turn and the drain turn are different generation cycles, possibly across a gateway restart. W3C `traceparent` context SHALL be carried on the queue payload itself (not as a runtime ambient) so the drain side can reconstruct the producer trace at announce/deliver time. Concretely:

1. `enqueueSystemEvent` / `enqueueSessionDelivery` capture the active `DiagnosticTraceContext` and serialize a `traceparent` header onto the queue entry.
2. `AnnounceQueueItem` extracts the `traceparent`, opens `continuation.queue.announce` as a **child** of the producer span (same trace, propagated parent), and re-injects it for the deliver-side span.
3. The terminal `continuation.queue.deliver` span closes the per-entry chain; the wakeup-side `continuation.delegate.spawn` from §6.6 consumes the same `traceparent` as a **link** (not parent), preserving the §6.6 invariant that spawn lives in a logically separate trace tree.

The enqueue→announce edge is a parent/child relationship (work the producer caused); the announce→spawn edge is a link (work the consumer chose to do). This asymmetry is load-bearing for trace-tree readability under fan-out.

**Carrier validation boundaries.** Trace carrier validation is intentionally stricter at tool-input boundaries than at substrate-enqueue boundaries:

| Boundary                        | Surfaces                                                         | Malformed `traceparent` behavior                                 | Rationale                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tool-input validation           | `continue_work`, `continue_delegate`, `request_compaction` tools | Reject with `ToolInputError` before any side effect              | Tool input is human or agent authored. Explicit feedback lets the caller repair the malformed carrier immediately.      |
| Substrate-enqueue normalization | `enqueueSystemEvent`, `enqueueSessionDelivery`                   | Silently drop the invalid carrier and continue the enqueue write | The substrate is plumbing that accepts values from many sources. A malformed carrier must not fail the queued delivery. |

This distinction is deliberate. Tool callers learn about invalid authored input. Queue producers keep robust delivery semantics: absence of trace context degrades observability, but it does not turn a system event or queued session delivery into a failed write.

**Chain-budget-capped span emission.** A runaway fan-out MUST NOT flood the trace backend by emitting unbounded queue-lifecycle spans. The cap is the **chain-budget step count, not the recipient count**:

- per-completion fan-out is **1 chain step**, regardless of recipient cardinality;
- once `chainStepBudgetRemaining <= 0`, queue-lifecycle spans for that chain SHALL be sampled at `0.0` (suppressed entirely) rather than emitted-and-dropped at the collector — back-pressure belongs at the producer, not the wire;
- the `continuation.disabled` counter (§6.6 tier-3) ticks once per suppressed span so operators can distinguish _silenced-by-cap_ from _never-emitted_.

This preserves the operator's ability to see the _shape_ of an over-budget chain (the parent fan-out span and its recipient-count attribute remain) while bounding the per-trace span volume to `O(chain_budget)`, not `O(chain_budget × recipients)`.

The cap is one axis surfaced as two refusals: a chain that has reached its budget does not thread `traceparent` past it (chain-depth decline), and a per-completion fan-out across N recipients consumes one chain step, not N (fan-out decline).

**Multi-recipient fan-out spans.** When a single delegate-return targets N recipients, the dispatcher SHALL emit:

- one parent `continuation.queue.fanout` span on the producer side, with attributes `recipientCount=N`, `chainStepConsumed=1`, `chainStepBudgetRemaining`;
- one child `continuation.queue.deliver` span **per target**, linked to the parent fan-out span (not parented), with `target` and per-recipient `outcome`.

The per-target span is a link rather than a parent so per-recipient failure isolation surfaces in the trace: one recipient timing out or being dropped does not orphan the fan-out parent or its sibling deliveries. A trace-tree query of the form `fanout.recipientCount > 1 AND child.outcome IN (deferred, dropped)` is sufficient to flag partial-fanout failures without conflating them with full-chain failures.

**Implementation note.** The `traceparent`-on-queue-payload contract above depends on queue payloads that can persist trace metadata and on dispatcher code that can resolve multi-recipient fan-out without duplicating the delegate run. Those are the same seams that make cross-session targeted return observable today and inter-node broadcast observable later.

### 6.8 Trace-context propagation across the continuation lifecycle

**Specification target.** §6.6 and §6.7 document the lifecycle and queue-side span schemas. This subsection documents the **end-to-end trace-context propagation contract** that ties them together: a root turn's trace identity SHALL survive across `continue_delegate` enqueue, child execution, return delivery (default, targeted, multi-recipient, fan-out), and post-restart replay. The desired trace shape is single-tree:

```
root turn          (traceid: T, span: R)
  └── continue_delegate child depth-1   (traceid: T, span: D1, parent: R)
        └── deeper delegate hop         (traceid: T, span: D2, parent: D1)
              └── return delivery       (traceid: T, span: Q,  parent: D2)
                    └── successor turn  (traceid: T, span: S,  parent: Q)
```

All spans share `traceid: T`. Each child names its producer as parent. Return-side spans (`Q`, `S`) preserve `T` so the return path is queryable as one tree, not as disconnected fragments per session boundary.

**Producer-side IN: tool/token/durable custody MUST accept a trace carrier.** The producer side of every continuation primitive SHALL accept and persist a W3C `traceparent` so the spawned child knows which trace it is part of. This is the missing seam at the structured-tool, bracket-token, runtime-type, and TaskFlow-persistence layers; without it, a delegate spawned from a traced parent has no way to know it should join the parent's trace tree.

| Surface                                              | Required additive field        | Persistence requirement                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `continue_delegate` tool                             | `traceparent` parameter        | passes through to enqueue/stage call sites                                                                                 |
| `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE:...]]`                          | `traceparent` directive option | parsed alongside silent/wake/target/fanout                                                                                 |
| `PendingContinuationDelegate`                        | `traceparent` runtime field    | propagates from producer into spawn metadata                                                                               |
| Custody-store `PendingDelegateState` (TaskFlow at C) | `traceparent` durable field    | persisted through the queued-record lifecycle, restart-stable; carried into the `SubagentRunRecord` at the custody handoff |
| Producer span helpers                                | `StartSpanOptions.traceparent` | the `diagnostics-otel` adapter already parent-stitches                                                                     |

The `diagnostics-otel` adapter already consumes `StartSpanOptions.traceparent` and parent-stitches via `trace.setSpanContext`; what is missing is the producer surfaces threading the carrier through to that consumption point. The carrier is additive at every layer — absence MUST NOT break any existing path; presence MUST stitch.

**Return-side OUT: default, targeted, multi-recipient, and fan-out paths MUST preserve the child-return `traceparent`.** When a delegate completes, the return delivery SHALL carry a `traceparent` that names the producing span as parent so the receiver can stitch the return into the same trace tree:

- **Default/silent return** (silent / silent-wake / direct visible reply): the return system event and the wake heartbeat carry `traceparent`; queue drain and successor-turn span emission consume it as parent.
- **Targeted single-recipient return** (`targetSessionKey` set): the resolved recipient's queued payload AND immediate system-event carry the same `traceparent`. This is the exact RFC §3.3 audit seam and is the byte-anchor for the §3.3 TODO replacement.
- **Multi-recipient explicit return** (`targetSessionKeys` array): every recipient receives the same `traceparent` on its queued payload AND its system event. All recipients preserve trace continuity, not none.
- **Fan-out return** (`fanoutMode: "tree" | "all"`): the resolved recipient set (ancestors or all-known-sessions) receives identical `traceparent` per recipient, with the producer-side `continuation.queue.fanout` parent span absorbing the chain-step cost (see §6.7 chain-budget cap below).

The symmetry is structural: producer-IN populates the carrier; return-OUT preserves and propagates it; queue-drain consumes it as parent. A trace-tree query like `traceid:T AND name:continuation.delegate.dispatch AND children include continuation.queue.deliver` SHALL return the complete return-path subtree even when the return crosses a session boundary or fans out to N recipients.

**Restart-resilience contract.** The durable session-delivery queue persists `traceparent` per entry (`src/infra/session-delivery-queue-storage.ts`). After gateway restart, replay sinks SHALL re-apply the per-entry `traceparent` when re-delivering: queued `systemEvent` replay, queued agent-turn replay (both routed and unrouted), and post-compaction delegate replay. **Recovery without re-application produces orphaned successor spans** — the trace-tree breaks at the restart boundary, which silently degrades end-to-end traceability for any continuation that survived a gateway lifecycle event.

**Anti-flood: chain-step accounting, not recipient accounting.** The cap rule from §6.7 governs trace-context propagation as well as span emission: per-completion fan-out across N recipients consumes **one chain step**, regardless of recipient cardinality. Threading the same `traceparent` to N recipients is one logical step in the chain budget; the trace-tree query flagging fan-out failures relies on the parent fan-out span and per-recipient `outcome` attributes, not per-recipient sibling traces. This means:

- a delegate-return targeting 50 recipients via `fanoutMode: "all"` consumes 1 chain step, not 50;
- the producer's `chainStepBudgetRemaining` decrement is by 1 at fan-out time, not by recipient count;
- once `chainStepBudgetRemaining <= 0`, the producer SHALL NOT thread `traceparent` past the cap (the chain-depth decline from §6.7); the successor wakes without a parent reference.

This preserves trace-tree readability under fan-out without conscripting downstream sessions' chain-budget into one producer's broadcast pattern.

**Seam map (implementation reference).** The trace-context audit enumerates seven implementation seams across producer, return, restart, and anti-flood paths. They group as:

| Seam group                 | Surfaces                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Producer input contract    | `continue-delegate-tool.ts`, `tokens.ts`, `continuation/types.ts`, `continuation/delegate-store.ts`      |
| Producer span creation     | `continuation-tracer.ts` helpers, `agent-runner.ts` call sites                                           |
| Child run / spawn metadata | spawn params + persisted run/session metadata (carrier reaches the executing child)                      |
| Default / direct return    | `subagent-announce.ts`, `subagent-announce-delivery.ts` (silent + visible paths)                         |
| Targeted / multi / fanout  | `continuation/targeting.ts` (`enqueueContinuationReturnDeliveries`)                                      |
| Queue drain / replay       | `session-system-events.ts`, `gateway/server-restart-sentinel.ts`, `post-compaction-delegate-dispatch.ts` |
| Anti-flood cap             | `runSubagentAnnounceFlow` + `enqueueContinuationReturnDeliveries` (chain-step accounting, not recipient) |

The seams are additive; none requires breaking changes to the existing tracer/adapter contracts. The diagnostics-otel adapter (`extensions/diagnostics-otel/src/continuation-tracer-adapter.ts`) already implements the consumer half of the contract; the work is at the producer-and-return surfaces, not the adapter.

**Verification contract.** End-to-end trace propagation SHALL be testable as one trace tree:

- a root turn that calls `continue_delegate` MUST emit `continuation.delegate.dispatch` with `traceparent` propagation flag set;
- the spawned child's first span MUST have the producer span as parent (same `traceid`);
- the child's return delivery MUST emit `continuation.queue.{enqueue.{system,delivery},announce,deliver}` with `traceparent` parented to the producing span;
- the wake-side successor turn's `continuation.delegate.spawn` MUST consume the same `traceparent` as a **link** (not parent), preserving the spawn-as-link invariant first stated in §6.7 (building on §6.6's lifecycle separation): spawn lives in a logically separate trace tree from the producer's chain;
- after a restart between enqueue and drain, the replayed delivery MUST preserve `traceparent` and MUST stitch the same parent span on the post-restart side.

A single integration test that traces a 3-hop chain across one cross-session targeted return + one fan-out broadcast + one post-restart replay, and asserts the rendered trace tree has the expected parent-edge topology, is sufficient to validate the contract end-to-end.

## 7. Safety and Security

### 7.1 Guardrails and human-user consent

The continuation feature is intentionally conservative by default.

| Constraint            | Default  | Purpose                              |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `enabled`             | `false`  | explicit deployment consent required |
| `maxChainLength`      | `10`     | prevents runaway recursion           |
| `costCapTokens`       | `500000` | bounds cost per chain                |
| `minDelayMs`          | `5000`   | prevents tight loops                 |
| `maxDelayMs`          | `300000` | bounds scheduling horizon            |
| `maxDelegatesPerTurn` | `5`      | prevents unbounded fan-out           |

Additional deployment note: delegate returns rely on an internal announce path. In channels configured with `requireMention: true`, the internal delivery path still bypasses mention gating, which preserves the continuation wake semantics.

### 7.2 Temporal gap and payload integrity

The delegated continuation path introduces a temporal gap between dispatch and return. During that period, task text, inline attachments, and pending delegate metadata are stored and transported as plaintext within the broader trust boundary of the OpenClaw instance.

**Attachment custody across the gap (custody revision).** Custody of a typed input snapshot passes through these holders, in order. At each step exactly one owner is responsible for scrubbing it.

1. **Pre-spawn.** The private payload file `<stateDir>/attachments/continuation-custody/<attachmentId>/payload.json` (at most 8 MiB, bound to the custody record ID and owner session), referenced by a continuation custody store record.
2. **Post-compaction queue, when used.** The `delivery_queue_entries` record, from the single release transaction until the queue entry settles.
3. **Child receipt directory.** After spawn, `<stateDir>/attachments/subagents/...`, recorded as the `subagent_runs` row's `attachmentId` and owned by upstream's subagent cleanup.

The continuation payload file is released when the custody handoff commits (§5.4.4), and on terminal failure, cancellation or reset. Session reset releases it immediately; at C that waited for the next startup reconcile. Payload files that no record references are removed by the startup custody reconcile. At C the owning record was a TaskFlow row.

Existing bounds reduce accidental overreach but are not cryptographic guarantees. Response-token delegate tasks are truncated at 4096 characters and cannot carry inline attachment blobs. Typed attachments use strict names and encodings, shared file/count/byte limits, private receipt directories, and a manifest with per-file SHA-256 hashes after child materialization. Those hashes do not authenticate the earlier custody-store (TaskFlow at C) or session-delivery queue hops. Post-compaction context reads use boundary-file protections and reject symlink or hardlink escapes from the workspace root. Session-delivery queue records and continuation payload files are local SQLite rows and private files, not encrypted envelopes.

Threat model:

| Vector               | Risk                                                 | Current state                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task interception    | evacuated context is read during transit or storage  | plaintext                                                         |
| Payload modification | returned result is altered before parent consumption | no integrity verification                                         |
| Marker spoofing      | attacker forges continuity metadata                  | no authenticated system-event origin                              |
| Announce injection   | fabricated completion delivered to parent            | origin tied primarily to session routing, not cryptographic proof |

For single-human-user deployments, this usually aligns with the existing trust boundary. For stricter environments, the recommended first mitigation is an audit trail with payload hashing: compute a digest over task text and attachments at dispatch time, store it alongside delegate metadata, and verify it on return.

Stronger options include HMAC signing, encrypted attachments, and signed announce payloads. None are required by the current implementation, but all are compatible with the present architecture.

## 8. Applicability

Continuation is appropriate when the next unit of work is known only after the current turn has produced evidence. Typical uses are resuming an open task after answering a message, scheduling a delayed follow-up instead of relying on a reminder, dispatching quiet background research that enriches a later turn, and splitting long synthesis work across time:

```text
continue_delegate(task="read README, CHANGELOG, and architecture doc; return a summary", mode="silent-wake")
continue_delegate(task="check CI status for PR #1234", delaySeconds=60, mode="silent-wake")
```

The agent elects each next step from what it learned in the current turn, rather than following a sequence fixed before the work began. With targeted return, the result can be routed to the session that can use it rather than only back to the caller.

Continuation is inappropriate as a substitute for human-user consent, for unbounded background loops, or for durable job orchestration that needs stronger integrity and retention guarantees than this substrate provides.

## 9. Testing

### 9.1 Test strategy and terminology

Testing combined unit and integration tests in the codebase, RFC-contract scenario suites (`src/auto-reply/continuation/rfc-contract.scenario.test.ts`, `src/auto-reply/continuation/custody-conjecture.scenario.test.ts`), and live exercises in persistent multi-agent sessions, including noisy-channel and quiet-channel validation of routing and gating paths.

### 9.2 Functional coverage

The automated suite covers:

- token parsing and stripping for `CONTINUE_WORK` and the delegate response token,
- delay parsing and clamping,
- continuation scheduling and cancellation,
- streaming false-positive prevention,
- delegate spawn behavior and failure handling,
- typed `continue_delegate()` attachment schema, validation, redacted results, and mounted child input,
- attachment preservation through delayed restart recovery and post-compaction staging/replay,
- explicit attachment-free policy for `continue_work()` and `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ...]]`,
- response-token target parsing for `target=`, `targets=`, and `fanout=`,
- same-host return-target resolution for default, explicit, multi-recipient, tree, and host-wide returns,
- session isolation,
- context-pressure thresholds and band dedup,
- event queue ordering,
- `silent` and `silent-wake` announce behavior,
- delegate store lifecycle,
- compaction delegate queues,
- configuration validation and boundary testing.

#### 9.2.1 Typed input attachment regression matrix

The attachment contract is exercised as one end-to-end boundary rather than
only as a tool-schema feature:

1. omitted and empty `attachments` input are equivalent and persist neither a
   snapshot nor a mount-hint field through immediate, delayed/restart, or
   post-compaction dispatch;
2. non-empty input is copied by value into durable custody (the continuation
   custody store and its payload file, §5.4), survives delayed recovery and
   post-compaction queue replay while unclaimed, and reaches the shared child materializer;
3. the shared spawn boundary re-reads current
   `tools.sessions_spawn.attachments` policy and limits, so a snapshot queued
   under an earlier permissive configuration is rejected if policy tightens
   before spawn;
4. terminal custody-store records and post-compaction queue settlement remove raw inline
   bytes, while generic `systemEvent` and `agentTurn` queue metadata is projected
   to descriptor-only `blob-sha256` references;
5. malformed transcript or queue attachment state fails closed without
   preserving secret bytes, while already-redacted canonical transcript state
   remains identity-stable for signed-thinking replay.

#### 9.2.2 Custody revision regression obligations

The custody revision (§5.4) replaces the storage underneath already-tested behavior, so the existing durable/restart, dispatch, recovery, attachment and RFC-contract suites keep their behavior assertions and run against the custody store. The custody-specific regressions are deterministic (no real timers, no per-test Gateway boots) and live mainly in `custody-conjecture.scenario.test.ts`, `delegate-claim-boundaries.test.ts`, `custody/custody-store.worker.test.ts`, `custody/custody-readiness.test.ts` and the `work-dispatch.*` and `delegate-dispatch.*` suites under `src/auto-reply/continuation/`. Each must fail on the defect or window it names:

1. **Election atomicity.** A concurrent election or parked-work supersede racing a claim fails the owner condition and commits nothing; a crash inside the transaction leaves the pre-state or the post-state; rollback restores superseded priors exactly.
2. **Delivered mark and terminal notice.** No second turn after a crash between the delivered mark and the finish; exactly one retry-exhausted notice across restarts; the notice insert and obligation clear are observed together or not at all.
3. **Custody handoff.** One test per §5.4.4 boundary. Boundary 4 hands off with no spawn; boundaries 2 and 3 make zero spawn calls and end in one interrupted notice that stays single across restarts; in-process failures follow the phase rules; the post-compaction queue drain never spawns an entry with an unresolved started attempt.
4. **Post-compaction release.** Release and queue insert commit together; a crash after the commit re-releases nothing; a failed enqueue re-stages.
5. **Tool/token parity.** Work, delegate and post-compaction produce identical custody records from the tool and token forms, apart from the attachment reference.
6. **List-by-owner.** Recovery, reset, `/status` counts and the sweep guards see the same live set; the hot-path projection is invalidated on every committed write.
7. **Launch key and the `continuation:` namespace (Q2).** No caller-visible launch-key field; the internal key is used verbatim as the Gateway run ID; non-backend `continuation:` keys are rejected; `childRunId` is deterministic per `(recordId, attemptId)`; a foreign-requester row is a collision, never adopted.

### 9.3 Findings from live validation

1. **Models can report tool calls they never made, and invent enrichment that never arrived.** Live validation must verify tool calls and recall against logs or ground truth.
2. **Runtime testing finds wiring gaps that unit tests and review miss.** Examples were a missing `requestCompactionOpts` forward and a registry write that dropped `silentAnnounce` and `wakeOnReturn`.
3. **Continuation depends on small pieces of routing metadata** (silent-wake flags, post-compaction state, sub-agent tool access) being preserved end to end.
4. **Session reset is an interruption boundary.** Explicit directive or inline-action reset cancels process timers, clears delayed reservations, resets chain state, and cancels pending durable work and delegates for the session, releasing payload files immediately. Delayed work does not survive `/new`.

## 10. Discussion and Future Work

### 10.1 Summary

This RFC documents a continuation system that changes OpenClaw sessions from purely reactive units into bounded, observable, agent-directed processes.

The implemented capability consists of these connected parts:

1. `continue_work()` for self-elected same-session continuation (§2.3).
2. `continue_delegate()` for delegated continuation, silent/silent-wake/post-compaction modes, and return routing to the parent, explicit sessions, ancestor tree, or all known same-host sessions (§2.4).
3. Context-pressure events for pre-compaction awareness and lich-pattern evacuation (§2.5, §4.2).
4. `request_compaction()` for volitional compaction after preparation (§2.5, §4.3).
5. Post-compaction delegate release for lifecycle-aware recovery: pre-compaction work staged electively and released directly into the post-compaction lifecycle event (§4.4).
6. Tool-primary design with response-token fallback for environments where tools are unavailable (§2.6, §2.7).
7. Path-specific substrates: the continuation custody store for same-session `continue_work`, pending delegates, and staged delegates (TaskFlow until #159179, §5.4); the subagent registry after the custody handoff; process timers only as ephemeral hedge/reservation prompts; and `session-delivery-queue` for targeted delegate returns, restart-recovered deliveries, and post-compaction handoff (§3.6).

The feature ships disabled by default, respects human-user guardrails, and integrates with the existing compaction and sub-agent machinery rather than replacing it.

### 10.2 Future directions

The nearest direction is better post-compaction recovery: richer saved working state, stronger payload integrity, and recovery strategies that preserve the shape of the work rather than only summary facts.

Managed child-to-recipient artifact claims ship as a control plane (§A.6). The remaining step is automatic byte presentation beyond it, such as transcript, TUI, MCP-content or channel rendering and forwarding. The typed input attachment path stays separate and does not become a return transport.

A later publish surface should follow the same rule as `continue_delegate()`: the agent names intent and audience, and the gateway chooses the transport, retry, delivery, addressing and trace mechanics. How trust, provenance, consent and freshness are maintained when enrichment crosses session or host boundaries is left open by this RFC.

## Appendix A. Extension contracts and future seams

### A.1 Bounded pre-compaction evacuation window

A proposed enhancement is a bounded pre-compaction grace window:

1. enqueue `[system:compaction-imminent]` with a deadline,
2. grant one turn for evacuation,
3. execute compaction after a non-extendable timeout.

This is analogous to a process receiving a graceful termination signal before forced termination. It is not implemented in the current codebase.

### A.2 Compaction-triggered evacuation delegate

Another proposed enhancement is an automatically spawned evacuation delegate that inherits pre-compaction context, writes `RESUMPTION.md`, updates memory files, and optionally dispatches ordered child work before the parent compacts.

The intended effect is to remove reliance on the parent having noticed the earlier advisory in time. This design is described but not implemented.

### A.3 Proposed `context_pressure` lifecycle hook

A future upstream hook could expose context-pressure detection as a formal modifying lifecycle hook rather than only as reply-pipeline logic. That would allow extensions to alter or suppress the event text, or add extension-specific guidance.

### A.4 Proposed configuration values not shipped in the current codebase

The following values appeared in design exploration but are **not** present in the shipped implementation:

```yaml
agents:
  defaults:
    continuation:
      compactionWarningThreshold: 0.95
      preCompactionTurnTimeoutMs: 30000
      compactionEvacuation: true
      evacuationTaskTemplate: |
        Session is being compacted. Preserve current work state.
```

They are documented here as design targets only.

### A.5 Typed `continue_delegate()` on-dispatch input attachments

> **Status: implemented input contract.** This section defines the shipped `continue_delegate()` typed attachment surface as an **on-dispatch parent-to-child input snapshot**, not as a return-artifact mechanism. The implementation remains bound by this section and its acceptance cases.

#### A.5.1 Public typed-tool contract

Only the typed `continue_delegate()` tool accepts the optional fields below. The response-token form `[[CONTINUE_DELEGATE: ...]]` and `continue_work()` have no attachment grammar or fields.

```ts
type InlineDelegateInput = {
  name: string;
  content: string;
  encoding?: "utf8" | "base64";
  mimeType?: string;
};

type ContinueDelegateInput = {
  // existing task/mode/delay/target fields
  attachments?: readonly InlineDelegateInput[];
  attachAs?: { mountPath?: string };
};
```

`attachments` is a bounded snapshot-by-value list. An omitted or empty list means no attachment input; an empty `attachAs` means no mount hint. The established camelCase/snake_case parameter normalization remains available for `attachAs`/`attach_as` and `mountPath`/`mount_path` where the tool surface supports it. The tool result may report an attachment **count** and a normalized mount hint, but MUST NOT echo attachment content, base64, or a derived preview.

The typed-tool call validates the whole set **before it is queued** using the same configured policy as `sessions_spawn` attachments: opt-in gate, maximum files/total bytes/per-file bytes, UTF-8 or strict base64 decoding, safe non-duplicate basenames, and mount-hint sanitization. The later child-spawn boundary validates/materializes again under then-current policy; a configuration change, corrupt durable row, or materialization failure fails the child spawn without exposing raw attachment content in a tool result, error, log, or corrupt-state diagnostic.

#### A.5.2 Dispatch snapshot and lifecycle

At successful typed-tool dispatch, the gateway captures validated attachment bytes by value in the pending delegate state. It does not defer a path lookup, URL fetch, or caller-workspace read until the child starts. The snapshot and mount hint must remain attached to exactly one new child delegate through all three execution routes:

1. immediate pending-delegate consumption;
2. delayed durable-custody recovery after process restart (TaskFlow at C; the custody store after §5.4); and
3. post-compaction staging, durable session-delivery queue replay, and eventual child spawn.

At child spawn, the shared sub-agent attachment materializer writes the bytes to the child workspace's private receipt directory (not the parent workspace and not `attachAs.mountPath` itself), emits only a count/byte/hash receipt, and tells the child that the materialized files are untrusted input. `attachAs.mountPath` is advisory prompt metadata, not authority to write to an arbitrary location. Existing session cleanup/retention policy governs the private receipt directory.

The snapshot stops at the child-workspace boundary. It never becomes a child completion attachment, return-delivery attachment, channel media upload, or parent workspace mount. Those are separate return-claim concerns defined in §A.6.

#### A.5.3 Required regression proofs

The typed input-attachment acceptance suite must fail if the typed input surface disappears again. It SHALL include an RFC-contract scenario (not only implementation-local tests) plus focused tests proving:

1. schema exposure and camel/snake parameter normalization; empty input is equivalent to absence;
2. pre-enqueue shared-policy validation, rejection, and redacted tool/error result;
3. immediate child spawn materializes the exact decoded bytes only in the child receipt directory;
4. delayed restart recovery preserves the snapshot and mount hint of an unclaimed record until one child spawn;
5. post-compaction staging and durable queue replay preserve the snapshot and mount hint until one child spawn, for entries with no started attempt;

### A.6 Managed delegate return claims and recipient arrival context

> **Status: implemented control plane.** This section defines the shipped contract. The `continue_delegate()` input includes `returnOptions` and `recipientContext`; child publication, immutable policy capture, claim lifecycle and recovery, metadata-only recipient projection, arrival context, durable delivery, and recipient-authorized list, inspect, materialize, and discard operations are implemented and tested together. Automatic rendering or forwarding of payload bytes is not part of this contract and remains future work.

#### A.6.1 Scope and non-goals

This extension defines a child-to-recipient result path for files or other binary artifacts produced during one delegate run. It is not a second spelling of typed inline attachments.

- **Typed input attachments (§A.5) remain parent-to-child input only.** Their bounded `{ name, content, encoding?, mimeType? }` snapshots are serialized by value at dispatch and materialized privately in the child workspace. They do not create artifact claims and are never copied back on completion.
- A returned artifact is an **opaque, host-managed claim** over host-retained bytes. A claim is bound to its producing delegate run, the immutable completion event that returned it, and the recipient set authorized by the original dispatch/return policy.
- A child must explicitly ask the host to publish an allowed regular file from its approved workspace/output area. The host canonicalizes the relative path, rejects traversal/symlink/non-regular-file escapes, applies configured size/type/redaction policy, stores the bytes privately, computes integrity metadata, and creates the claim.
- The completion protocol persists claim metadata, not raw content, a child workspace path, an arbitrary URL, a hash used as authority, tool output, final prose, or a channel `media=` reference. It must not infer artifacts from any of those sources.
- This extension does not automatically mount bytes into a parent workspace, inject bytes into a prompt, upload media to a channel, fetch a URL, or turn a claim into a current instruction. Recipient materialization is an implemented explicit, recipient-authorized operation; generic rendering or forwarding remains separate future work.
- Generic arbitrary `data: JsonValue` is not part of the first claim-return slice. It needs a concrete durable consumer and independent compatibility/security design.

A child has no implicit right to publish outputs merely because it completed. At accepted dispatch, the host creates the immutable, host-owned `DelegateArtifactReturnPolicyV1` described in §A.6.4. It is the sole authority for whether that delegate run may publish, which recipients may later resolve, and the publication bounds (count, MIME/type, byte limits, approved output boundary, and retention deadline). The child never supplies or widens those facts.

**V1 dispatch-time activation.** Only the typed `continue_delegate()` path may request this extension:

```ts
type DelegateArtifactModeV1 = "forbidden" | "optional" | "required";

type ContinueDelegateReturnOptionsV1 = {
  artifacts?: DelegateArtifactModeV1;
};

type ContinueDelegateInput = {
  // existing task/mode/delay/target fields
  returnOptions?: ContinueDelegateReturnOptionsV1;
  recipientContext?: { purpose: string };
};
```

This is a closed capability request, not a caller-authored attachment/header bag. Omission means `artifacts: "forbidden"`, preserving text-only legacy behavior. At accepted dispatch, the host validates the requested mode against configured policy, snapshots the effective mode in `DelegateArtifactReturnPolicyV1`, and rejects a disallowed request before child spawn. It SHALL never infer artifact permission or requirement from task prose, filenames, tool output, or child instructions. `forbidden` rejects publication; `optional` permits zero or more policy-conforming publications; `required` permits publication and requires at least one finalized `available` claim for successful completion. An absent, denied, invalid, expired-before-finalization, or otherwise unavailable required publication produces one durable typed completion failure bound to the same dispatch/completion provenance. It MUST NOT silently downgrade to text-only success, create a fallback claim, or mint a new completion on replay.

**V1 publication request.** The implemented child-facing publication tool is `delegate_artifacts_publish`; its closed input accepts only a bounded list of child-workspace-relative candidate paths. It accepts neither raw bytes, URLs, hashes, `media://` locators, caller-selected claim IDs, nor a parent destination. The host resolves those relative paths against the policy's approved output root after the child asks to publish, re-checks the regular-file/no-symlink/type/size/redaction constraints, and redacts the candidate path from all channel-visible tool results, logs, diagnostics, and error strings. A rejected or absent candidate produces an explicit typed publication outcome; it never falls back to final prose, tool output, or a path string.

**Recipient projection.** A claim is authority and provenance metadata, not a new public attachment-header language. V1 reuses the existing public gateway-protocol [`ArtifactSummary`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/packages/gateway-protocol/src/schema/artifacts.ts) vocabulary as its only recipient-visible artifact item. The projection identifies a host-managed output with ordinary MIME, name and size metadata, but it does **not** inline, serialize, prompt-inject, or otherwise make payload bytes readable at completion. Image, PDF/report, audio, dataset, and patch outputs all use it through the free-form `type` plus MIME metadata. Recipient-bound materialization is a separate, explicitly authorized operation (§A.6.4). `AgentToolResult.content` (`TextContent | ImageContent`) is not this representation.

`Pick<ArtifactSummary, …>` is **not** a sufficient enforcement mechanism: the existing runtime schema also admits `sessionKey`, `runId`, `taskId`, `messageSeq`, and `download` modes other than `unsupported`. Before any continuation custody envelope is serialized, a private adapter named `toDelegateArtifactSummaryV1(claim)` SHALL freshly construct and strict-validate this closed seven-field projection:

```ts
{
  id: string;
  type: string;
  title: string;
  mimeType?: string;
  sizeBytes?: number;
  source: "delegate-return";
  download: { mode: "unsupported" };
}
```

The adapter SHALL neither spread nor accept a caller-provided `ArtifactSummary`; it creates a new object and rejects any additional key before the envelope boundary. The envelope may be typed as `ArtifactSummary[]` only for outputs this adapter has constructed. The adapter SHALL derive `title`, `type`, and `mimeType` only from host-validated claim metadata, never from arbitrary child strings, the candidate path or filename, task prose, tool output, or channel state; a present `mimeType` must satisfy MIME syntax. It SHALL reject control characters and path-, URI-, URL-, locator-, or bearer-shaped values in all three fields, failing the publication or claim validation rather than redacting or substituting a child-derived value.

For a managed delegate return, `id` is the host-issued opaque claim ID, never a storage locator or bearer capability; `source` is the fixed host-authored value `"delegate-return"`; and `download` is always `{ mode: "unsupported" }`. The generic `artifacts.download` response can expose base64 `data` or a `url`, so it is excluded from this return path. A recipient resolves a claim only through the recipient-bound operations of §A.6.4, which check the recipient, delivery, completion, and policy binding before reading private bytes. The typed continuation return envelope may carry the adapter's outputs next to its ordinary text and host-authored arrival context, but SHALL introduce no new public artifact descriptor, MIME/count header bag, or locator-bearing content part. A delegate-return recipient projection SHALL NOT use `sessionKey`, `runId`, `taskId`, or `messageSeq` unless a later RFC version independently proves that it is authorized recipient-visible provenance.

The following is the logical claim projection at the private host completion boundary. It is **not** an independently serialized public attachment/content schema; its recipient-visible counterpart is the existing `ArtifactSummary` projection chosen above.

```ts
type DelegateArtifactRef = {
  kind: "delegate_artifact";
  claimId: string; // opaque identifier only; never a path, URL, content address, or bearer credential
  name: string;
  mimeType?: string;
  sizeBytes: number;
  sha256: string; // integrity metadata, not resolution authority
};

type DelegateCompletionRecord = {
  text?: string;
  artifacts?: readonly DelegateArtifactRef[]; // projected as ArtifactSummary[] to recipients
};
```

The host owns both the claim identifier and all authorization decisions. A `claimId` is an opaque identifier only: possession is never authorization, it carries no bearer capability, and it cannot resolve without separate authenticated recipient, producing-run, delivery, and current-lifecycle checks. `name`, MIME type, size, and digest help a recipient assess a result but are not sufficient to retrieve it.

#### A.6.2 Immutable claim record, lifecycle, and recovery

The durable server-side claim record SHALL retain immutable provenance and delivery facts separately from display metadata:

- claim ID, private retained object identity, content digest/type/size, and host publication timestamp;
- producing child session and delegate run; originating parent session/dispatch; immutable causal completion-event ID; completion-finalization idempotency key; and the immutable `DelegateArtifactReturnPolicyV1` identity/version;
- the complete intended recipient set and return route **inside the private host record only**; per-recipient delivery projections are filtered as specified in §A.6.3;
- decision, scheduled/`notBefore`, enqueue, child-start, child-complete, claim-create, completion-finalize, first-delivery, and each replay-attempt timestamp where applicable;
- claim/backing lifecycle state and transitions: `pending` (no completion binding and not externally resolvable), `staged` (completion facts retained solely because the runtime gate is disabled and not externally resolvable), `available` (atomically bound to the immutable completion), and terminal backing states `expired`, `revoked`, `orphaned`, and `purged`; plus retention deadline and safe revocation/orphan cause where disclosure is permitted. Recipient outcomes and completion dispositions are separate immutable records: each eligible original recipient has `available` or terminal `unavailable(reason)`; a global gate failure has one `global-failed(reason)` completion disposition and no recipient bindings; and a zero-eligible set has exactly one mode-specific completion disposition (`required-failed` or `optional-zero-eligible`) in addition to the recipient tombstones;
- durable delivery/replay attempt identity, acknowledgement or terminal delivery state, and idempotency linkage so recovery cannot manufacture a second claim or relabel an old completion as new.

Publication-to-completion binding is a crash-safe transaction, not two best-effort events. The host first persists a `pending` claim under the accepted policy and may copy bytes into its private retained store, but it MUST NOT emit a `DelegateArtifactRef`, arrival context, or resolver-visible claim until it atomically/idempotently binds that claim to one immutable completion event and transitions it to `available`. A crash after retained-byte copy but before binding leaves only a non-resolvable `pending` record. Recovery may finalize it only by replaying the same completion-finalization idempotency key and matching immutable run, policy, and integrity facts; otherwise it SHALL mark the record `orphaned` and revoke/purge retained bytes under the policy cleanup deadline. A crash after finalization but before delivery replays the already finalized completion; it never makes another claim.

A restart between publication, completion persistence, and delivery SHALL recover from this record idempotently. It SHALL preserve original dispatch and completion timestamps, IDs, policy version, recipient binding, and integrity metadata unchanged. Expired, revoked, orphaned, absent, unauthorized, or corrupt claims fail closed: they cannot resolve, materialize, or silently degrade into a path/URL/content fallback. Cleanup of the child workspace cannot invalidate a valid retained claim before its retention policy says so; expiry/revocation does invalidate later resolution even if some old child path once existed.

#### A.6.3 Recipient arrival context, including inter-session delivery

A dispatching parent often remembers why it created a child. An explicit `targetSessionKey`, `targetSessionKeys`, or fan-out recipient may have **zero awareness** of that dispatch. For that recipient, a valid claim without a delivery envelope is a mystery package.

Every child-to-recipient return therefore SHALL have a typed, host-authored arrival context. It is part of the delivery event—not optional UI decoration, child prose, or a bare `System:` string. The recipient projection SHALL state at least:

- delivery class (`delegate result` to the dispatching parent or explicit `inter-session enrichment`) and silent/announced delivery mode; it may identify the recipient's own direct binding but does not disclose sibling identities, route membership, or fan-out cardinality;
- immutable dispatch ID; only an approved source identity or privacy-safe host-generated origin label; producer child/run; causal completion-event ID; and the recipient's own authorization binding for this delivery;
- original dispatch, scheduled/`notBefore`, completion, and actual delivery/replay times; the return-policy version; and only the recipient's authorized claim availability/revocation/expiry state at delivery;
- a bounded `recipientContext` captured at dispatch explaining why the target is being woken or enriched. V1 is exactly `{ purpose: string }`: a required, non-empty, scalar-safe string of at most 1,024 UTF-8 bytes for every non-parent recipient; it is omitted rather than invented for the ordinary dispatching parent. It is caller-supplied, immutable once the host accepts the dispatch, and visibly labelled as contextual provenance—not host authority, executable instruction, or a substitute for the child result. It follows the same sensitive-content redaction policy as the dispatch task and is never derived from final prose, tool output, workspace state, or an artifact.

The full recipient set, sibling recipient identities, the complete route/fan-out set, fan-out cardinality, child-only workspace data, unapproved claim metadata, and another session's private history stay in the private host record. The recipient projection provides only the approved causal context needed to judge: **this was produced there, for this declared purpose, then; it reached me now; and it is/was valid under this claim.** A legacy record lacking a required provenance field must say that context is unavailable; it must not fabricate a complete-looking envelope. Artifact-capable inter-session returns must not arrive unlabeled.

#### A.6.4 Authorization, v1 return-policy authority, and explicit resolution

Publishing is authorized only for the active producing delegate run and its approved output boundary. Resolving or materializing is authorized only for an intended recipient whose claim remains available under current policy. Recipient authorization is evaluated again at resolution time; claim IDs are opaque identifiers, not bearer permission to bypass those checks.

**V1 return-policy authority.** V1 introduces no agent-authored generic policy language and no recipient expansion beyond the existing typed `continue_delegate()` return-target fields. At accepted dispatch, the host validates the requested route under the ordinary same-host targeting rules, resolves the route once, and creates an immutable host-owned `DelegateArtifactReturnPolicyV1` record. It contains its identity/version, dispatch ID, producing delegate-run binding, approved output boundary, the exact authorized recipient session identities, `maxArtifactCount`, allowed MIME/type policy, per-artifact and aggregate byte limits, and retention deadline/cleanup policy. These are the host policy snapshot at acceptance, not child input or display metadata. An artifact-capable dispatch whose target cannot be resolved and authorized at that point, or whose requested publication exceeds the captured policy, fails closed before child spawn or publication respectively.

**Runtime disable and recovery.** The continuation-enabled and cross-session-targeting gates are checked before an artifact-capable dispatch is accepted; their resolved decision is stored in the immutable policy snapshot. The relevant current runtime gate is also checked atomically with every transition that would spawn the child, create/finalize a claim, or begin recipient delivery. A disabled gate never grants a new capability merely because the accepted policy once permitted it.

The behavior is exact for three mutually exclusive lifecycle windows:

1. **Disabled before child spawn.** Recovery SHALL classify and dead-letter malformed durable records yet leave valid work unspawned and otherwise deferred until re-enable. It SHALL not materialize inputs, consume a retry, mutate chain state, create/finalize/publish a claim, deliver, resolve, or materialize.
2. **Disabled after child completion but before claim finalization.** The host MAY durably stage the immutable completion facts and, where needed to resume the same bounded transaction, non-resolvable private candidate bytes or an already-existing `pending` record under the accepted policy. That staging is not a finalized claim and is not a recipient-visible publication. While disabled, the host MUST NOT create a new claim, transition any claim to `available`, bind/finalize a claim to the completion, emit a `DelegateArtifactRef` or arrival context, deliver, resolve/materialize, consume a retry, or mutate chain state. A finalization transaction that observes disable before its atomic commit remains staged; it does not privately finalize and wait for delivery. Before a staged record may finalize after re-enable, the same atomic transaction MUST recheck the current relevant runtime gate, the producing-run/completion integrity binding, current deny/revoke/expiry policy, and the original dispatching-parent continuity/authorization binding. A captured acceptance-time policy is not by itself sufficient.

   `staged` is only the runtime-disabled defer state. After re-enable, a recheck failure MUST NOT remain staged, be retried as a future finalization candidate, or revive after the fact. **The global gate is evaluated before any recipient outcome is created.** If corrupt/unreadable retained state, producing-run/completion integrity mismatch, original dispatching-parent incarnation/authorization failure, current explicit policy denial/revocation, or current expiry/policy-shortened expiry fails that gate, the transaction SHALL atomically record exactly one terminal completion-level `global-failed(reason)` outcome and create **zero recipient bindings**. The reason is fixed by this precedence: corrupt/unreadable retained state (`purged` private backing); producing-run/completion integrity mismatch or original-parent failure (`orphaned` private backing); explicit denial/revocation (`revoked` private backing); then expiry/shortened eligibility (`expired` private backing followed only by cleanup). `global-failed(reason)` is the durable, recipient-independent disposition; the backing lifecycle label is not a recipient outcome. A global failure permits no recipient route lookup, substitution, re-resolution, rebind, ref/name/access projection, delivery/replay, retry accounting, chain-state mutation, or replacement completion. Recovery and replay MUST return that same immutable global outcome and cannot turn it into fan-out.

   Recipient validation is deliberately non-scalar only after the global gate has passed. The transaction MUST independently recheck every snapshotted recipient incarnation and authorization binding. **Each original recipient gets exactly one immutable, durable recipient outcome:** a currently valid original binding may become `available`; an invalid, rebound, revoked, expired, absent, or unauthorized original binding becomes terminal recipient-scoped `unavailable(reason)`. `unavailable(reason)` is a tombstone, not an alias for backing cleanup: a later purge MAY delete private retained backing only, but MUST preserve the original recipient tombstone with no ref/name/access projection. An unavailable recipient MUST NOT block independently valid original recipients, and no cleanup, later recipient substitution, route re-resolution, rebind, access path, delivery/replay, retry accounting, chain-state mutation, or replacement completion may erase, reopen, or turn that unavailable outcome into an available one. Recipient-specific arrival and unavailable projections MUST NOT reveal sibling identities, siblings' outcomes, or route cardinality.

   If the global gate passes but **zero original recipients are eligible**, every original recipient SHALL have its terminal `unavailable(reason)` tombstone and there SHALL be zero available bindings. The completion disposition is mode-specific and immutable: `required` records exactly one durable `required-failed` completion outcome—not one failure per recipient—while `optional` records exactly one terminal `optional-zero-eligible` disposition while preserving the ordinary child completion as artifact-free. Neither mode may substitute, re-resolve, retry against a new recipient, or later revive an unavailable outcome after cleanup, rebind, recovery, or replay. Before this complete transaction commits, staged state MUST yield no recipient-visible ref, name, access path, delivery/replay, retry accounting, chain-state mutation, or replacement completion.

3. **Disabled after claim finalization but before delivery.** The already-finalized, immutable claim/completion binding remains retained with its original IDs and timestamps. The host MUST defer every delivery/replay and all resolution/materialization until re-enable; it MUST NOT re-finalize, mint a replacement completion or claim, consume a retry, or mutate chain state. Ordinary expiry, revocation, corruption handling, and a current-policy denial still fail closed; disable never reopens, extends, or widens the claim.

Re-enable may resume only the same demonstrably incomplete stored operation idempotently, preserving original dispatch/completion/finalization provenance and appending the actual delivery/replay attempt facts. Disable never widens a route, recipient set, output boundary, or retention period.

The V1 mapping is exact:

- no target fields → the dispatching parent alone;
- `targetSessionKey` → that one resolved target alone;
- `targetSessionKeys` → the deduplicated, resolved listed targets;
- `fanoutMode: "tree"` → the ancestor sessions in the accepted continuation chain at dispatch; and
- `fanoutMode: "all"` → the addressable same-host sessions in the host snapshot at dispatch.

A later-created session, a target discovered only after dispatch, a changed route, or a replay attempt does not expand this policy. Completion delivery and replay use the stored recipient snapshot, preserving the route facts for provenance even if a recipient later becomes unavailable. The host MUST also bind each delivery to the producing run, immutable completion event, recipient identity, and policy snapshot; a claim identifier alone has no authority. A future typed return-policy surface may supersede this V1 mapping only with a new policy version and explicit migration/replay semantics.

The implementation must make artifact resolution explicit and auditable. It must bind the resolution to a claim ID, recipient identity, delivery/completion provenance, and a chosen safe destination or renderer. It must not use parent trust in final prose, workspace paths, file hashes, arbitrary URLs, or channel-media handles as an authorization substitute. Multi-recipient delivery may share retained bytes only if every recipient gets an independently authorized claim binding or an equivalently auditable recipient binding; no guessed sibling/session identifier may resolve another recipient's result.

**Shipped resolution surface.** The receiving-session API defines closed, typed operations for list/inspect, materialize to a receiver-chosen safe destination, and discard; each returns a stable typed outcome for `available`, `expired`, `revoked`, `missing`, `corrupt`, and `unauthorized`. Every action records an audit row in the host audit trail carrying the action, its typed outcome, the recipient session key/id, and the time. Claim-scoped actions (inspect, materialize-authorize, materialize, discard) additionally bind the claim id; when an existing claim resolves to a non-`available` outcome, they also bind its producing flow id. Materialize records the chosen destination. `list` is not claim-scoped and records no claim or flow binding. Delivery and completion provenance is not stored on the audit row itself — it lives on the claim/policy rows that the claim id resolves to. “Forward” remains an ordinary separately-authorized channel/message action after explicit resolution; it is not a claim operation and is out of scope for automatic return delivery.

#### A.6.5 Acceptance matrix

Regression tests (`src/agents/delegate-artifacts*.test.ts`, `src/agents/delegate-artifact-policy.integration.test.ts`, `src/agents/tools/delegate-artifacts-tool.test.ts`, `src/agents/subagent-announce.continuation-return.delegate-artifacts.test.ts`, `src/infra/session-delivery-queue.managed-artifact.test.ts`) bind the implementation to these criteria:

1. **Normal parent return:** an authorized parent receives only the metadata projection of §A.6.1, with an arrival context tied to the exact child run and completion; bytes become available only through an explicit recipient-authorized materialize to a receiver-chosen destination.
2. **Targeted/inter-session return:** a recipient with zero prior awareness of the dispatch, including a silent enrichment, can tell the return from fresh direct instruction using the host-authored arrival context, without receiving private prompt or history bytes.
3. **Delayed and post-compaction return:** original schedule and completion facts stay distinct from delivery time, so a late delivery is visibly delayed rather than fresh.
4. **Restart and replay:** publication, completion persistence, delivery, acknowledgement, and replay are idempotent; original IDs, timestamps, policy, and recipient binding remain unchanged.
5. **Cleanup and retention:** removing the child workspace does not erase an in-retention claim; expiry, revocation, purge, unauthorized access, missing bytes, and corrupt metadata fail closed with no fallback path, URL, or content.
6. **Isolation:** a sibling, guessed session, guessed claim ID, fan-out outsider, or post-expiry recipient cannot resolve, materialize, or receive another recipient's artifact.
7. **No implicit promotion:** final prose, tool output, workspace paths, hashes, URLs, and `message(action=send, media=...)` cannot create a claim; claims do not auto-mount, prompt-inject, or channel-upload.
8. **Identifier and policy isolation:** a claim ID without the authenticated recipient/run/delivery binding fails; the V1 policy snapshot matches the accepted default, explicit, tree, or host-wide route exactly and cannot expand after dispatch or during replay.
9. **Publish/finalize crash safety:** crashes before retained-byte copy, after copy but before finalization, and after finalization but before delivery leave no resolvable unbound claim, create no duplicate claim, and either finalize by the same idempotency key or orphan, revoke, and purge the pending object.
10. **Recipient privacy:** targeted and fan-out recipients receive only their own binding and approved context and claim projection, never sibling identities, the route set or its cardinality, or unauthorized claim metadata.
11. **Publication-input isolation:** the publication API accepts only bounded relative candidate paths under the approved output root; raw bytes, URLs, hashes, `media://` references, claim IDs, and parent-selected destinations are rejected and redacted, and a missing or denied candidate is an explicit typed result.
12. **Canonical-content gate:** every V1 artifact class projects through the seven-field `toDelegateArtifactSummaryV1()` output only, under the derivation and rejection rules of §A.6.1. The projection carries no raw bytes, path, URL, digest, generic `artifacts.get`/`artifacts.download` capability, `sessionKey`, `runId`, `taskId`, or `messageSeq`; a delegate-return claim is addressable through neither legacy artifact RPC nor transcript collection; and `id` cannot resolve without the current recipient/delivery/completion/policy checks.
13. **Runtime disable and terminal matrix:** the three disable windows of §A.6.4 behave as specified. A global gate failure records one `global-failed(reason)` outcome with zero recipient bindings; mixed recipients after global success each finalize to one `available` or durable `unavailable(reason)` tombstone; zero eligible recipients record exactly one `required-failed` or `optional-zero-eligible` disposition. No recovery, replay, cleanup, or rebind revives, substitutes, re-delivers, or charges a retry for a terminal case, and no window spawns extra work, widens authorization, or replaces completion identity.
14. **Activation and absence:** omitted `returnOptions` is text-only `forbidden`; `optional` accepts a text-only successful completion; `forbidden` rejects a publish attempt without a claim; `required` with zero valid finalized claims yields one durable typed completion failure. Replay preserves the original mode, completion identity and times, and recipient snapshot.
15. **Explicit recipient operations:** list/inspect, materialize, and discard are typed, recipient-authorized, and auditable, with stable fail-closed unavailable and unauthorized outcomes. No claim operation sends or forwards a channel message.

| Dimension         | `sessions_spawn`                                         | `continue_delegate()`                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Initiation        | visible, human-user- or agent-invoked task               | continuation-specific delegated follow-up                                                                    |
| Visibility        | always announced                                         | supports `silent`, `silent-wake`, and `post-compaction`                                                      |
| Cost model        | independent child sessions                               | chain-aware cost and depth guards                                                                            |
| Timing            | immediate                                                | immediate or delayed                                                                                         |
| Model selection   | optional `model` override (inherits parent when omitted) | optional `model` override (inherits parent when omitted) — parity with `sessions_spawn`                      |
| Input attachments | typed inline attachments mounted in the child workspace  | same typed inline input and shared materialization policy; preserved across delayed/post-compaction dispatch |
| Return semantics  | normal announce                                          | default, explicit target, multi-recipient, tree/all fan-out, silent, wake-on-return, lifecycle release       |
| Best fit          | explicit visible tasks                                   | background enrichment and continuation-carrying work                                                         |

`requestHeartbeatNow()` remains lighter than either, but it carries no task payload and no chain state. It is a wake signal, not a continuation-bearing result channel.

Model-override parity closes the last first-class capability gap between the two primitives: `continue_delegate(model)` accepts the same provider/model ref shape as `sessions_spawn(model)`, normalizes the `"default"` sentinel to "inherit parent," and forwards the resolved override to the shared spawn endpoint. The remaining differences are intentional (chain/cost guards, silent and post-compaction return modes, multi-recipient fan-out) rather than missing features.

`sessions_send`-style addressing can put a message into another session, but it is not equivalent to `continue_delegate()` return routing. `continue_delegate()` owns the whole continuation envelope: delayed dispatch, silent or silent-wake delivery, chain/cost guards, post-compaction staging, and byte-identical multi-recipient return from one delegate run. That makes it the right primitive when the result is continuation-bearing work rather than an ordinary inter-session message.

### B.4 Async-only volitional compaction: design decision

`request_compaction()` is intentionally async-only. This is a design decision in the implemented feature, not an alternative that was rejected. It is placed here alongside alternatives for completeness.

Rationale:

1. existing platform compaction already occurs between turns;
2. synchronous compaction would create user-visible hangs;
3. the agent should be able to finish its current reply before the lifecycle transition;
4. `post-compaction` delegate release already covers the main use case for “compact, then continue.”

A synchronous compaction mode is not implemented.

### C.2 Inherited behavioral limitations

The continuation system inherits three broader limitations from persistent deployments:

1. **Self-bound context occlusion.** Too many recurring lifecycle messages can displace the agent's useful conversational context.
2. **Channel context poisoning.** In open-listen multi-agent channels, one agent's passive status messages can influence the rest of the fleet.
3. **Timer-handle volatility.** The continuation custody store and `session-delivery-queue` provide durable records for their paths, including same-session `continue_work`; concrete in-process hedge timer handles can still be lost on restart. Recovery preserves the durable work while possibly changing exact wake timing.

These are not correctness bugs in continuation itself, but they materially shape safe deployment and future design work.

## Appendix D. Detailed implementation evidence

### D.1 Context-pressure inclusion sketch

The pre-run inclusion path can be summarized as follows. This is illustrative pseudocode, not a copy of the source:

```typescript
const threshold = resolveContinuationRuntimeConfig(cfg).contextPressureThreshold;
const earlyWarningBand = resolveContinuationRuntimeConfig(cfg).earlyWarningBand;

if (threshold && contextWindow > 0 && totalTokens > 0) {
  const ratio = totalTokens / contextWindow;
  const bands = pressureBandsFor(threshold, earlyWarningBand);
  const crossed = highestCrossedBand(ratio, bands);

  if (postCompaction || (totalTokensFresh !== false && crossed !== lastBand)) {
    enqueueSystemEvent(
      `[system:context-pressure] ${Math.round(ratio * 100)}% context consumed ...`,
      { sessionKey },
    );
  }
}
```

The `totalTokensFresh !== false` check is the staleness guard: only an explicit `false` blocks the fire (undefined or `true` both pass through). The post-compaction lifecycle event bypasses this guard entirely (§4.2 precondition note).

The key property is **pre-run inclusion**: the event is enqueued and then drained into the same upcoming system prompt.

## Appendix E. Proposed follow-up upstream change: register native spawns before acknowledging

Design decision Q4 calls for this change in upstream. §5.4.4 ("Upstream closure of boundary 3") describes what changes in continuation recovery once it lands. The citations below are pinned at `4d8c9bdd`.

The proposed change follows.

> **Change:** Native `sessions_spawn`: persist the `subagent_runs` row before the Gateway acknowledges the child run
>
> **Problem.** A native subagent spawn creates the child session, materializes attachments, dispatches the Gateway `agent` turn, and only then calls `registerSubagentRun` (`src/agents/subagents/spawn/subagent-spawn.ts:spawnSubagentDirect`, `src/agents/spawn-pipeline.ts:runSpawnPipeline`). If the process stops after the Gateway accepts the run and before registration commits, the child can run with no `subagent_runs` row.
>
> - Startup marks the orphan child session interrupted (`src/gateway/server-startup-session-migration.ts`), but no registry row exists. The requester gets no completion obligation and no settle wake for that child.
> - A caller that recorded the run ID before dispatching, so that it can reconcile after a restart, cannot tell "the Gateway never accepted this run" apart from "the run was accepted and may have executed". Following the doctrine in `recoverInterruptedSubagentRow` ("Old launch receipts are evidence of uncertain effects, never permission to replay a child"), the caller has to treat both as uncertain and must not retry either.
>
> In process, `spawnSubagentDirect` already narrows the window: it terminates the accepted run if registration throws. A crash in the window is not covered.
>
> **Precedent.** Plugin subagents already register first. `src/gateway/agent-turn/agent-run-subagent.ts` calls `registerPluginSubagentRunFromGateway` with the comment "Persist the actual execution owner before acknowledging a plugin dispatch."
>
> **Proposal.** Give native spawns the same order. The registry row is committed as part of Gateway acceptance, under the run ID the Gateway uses (the request's idempotency key, `src/gateway/agent-turn/agent-request-preflight.ts`), before the `agent` request is acknowledged and before the run can execute. If the row cannot be committed, the dispatch is refused and the run never starts. After a restart, the invariant is: an accepted native child always has a `subagent_runs` row, so a missing row under a known run ID proves the run was never accepted.
>
> **Acceptance.**
>
> - A crash injected after acceptance and before acknowledgement leaves a registry row that `recoverInterruptedSubagentRow` finalizes and delivers as an error, with no replay.
> - A crash before the row commits leaves no accepted run, and the child never executes.
> - A registration failure refuses the dispatch; the in-process terminate-after-accept path is no longer needed for native spawns.
> - Existing sibling behavior is unchanged: collector `swarm_` replay-key lookup, plugin subagent registration, and `sessions_yield` settle wakes.
>
> **Update behavior.** No schema change is expected: `subagent_runs` already holds these rows. Rows written by older builds are unaffected, and the new invariant holds only for runs accepted by builds that ship the change.
